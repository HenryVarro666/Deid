History of Present Illness:  65 year old RH gentleman with Hx notable for HTN and CASHD, was working on taxes and making barbecued chicken this afternoon, when at 1am he had the sudden onset of feeling "dizzy, disoriented" and having "slurred speech". He reports that he "couldn't remember what I was trying to say", and that his words both sounded "like [I] was drunk". He also stated that at times, when he would try to talk, nothing would come out. He walked downstairs, with difficulty, and his wife noticed that in the hallway he was bumping into items on (falling to) his right. Denies weakness, paresthesias, pain.  EMTs report that when asked the President's name, pt responded "Chrysler Dodge". Brought initially to OSH, symptoms mostly resolved within 20 minutes. I- CT at OSH negative.

 Impression: 65 year old gentleman with multiple stroke risk factors, onset of dysarthria, aphasia, dizziness, ataxia at 13:00 today. Symptoms improving over first 30-60 minutes, but residual RUE drift, dysarthria, and (initally) upgoing R toe. Suspicious for L MCA cortical event. L ICA stenosis and/or embolic event +/- fetal left PCA possible concerns (?cortical vs v-b etiology of dizziness). Cannot obtain CTA secondary to elevated creatinine.  



Plan:  

1.	Admit to RDA 

2.	MRI/MRA. MR Perfusion study if L ICA stenosis or suggestion of intracranial stenosis. 

3.	As event occurred on ASA, provide heparin PTT 60-80, continue ASA at decreased dose (81 qD). Watch platelets, as pt starting with platelets =  150

4.	Hold antihypertensive, but continue isosorbide for known cardiac ischemic history. 

5.	Echo, Holter (for known bradycardia; eval for events with HR <<40. 

6.	PT/speech therapy. 

7.	Careful glycemic control (holding metformin).
