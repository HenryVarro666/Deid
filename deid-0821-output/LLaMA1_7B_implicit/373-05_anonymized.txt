CC:  wt gain
HPI: Mr. Jimenez is a 78 yo male with h/o Hodgkin&#8217;s dz s/p chemo, T2m, HTN, AAA, CHF (last TTE 2086 with LVEF 50%, RVSP 45), a fib on coumadin, recently discharged after prolonged hospital stay for PNA &amp; complicated pleural effusion requiring chest tube placement, now returns from rehab with 20 lb wt gain since discharge on 3/09 &amp; 7.5 lbs since 3/20.  Patient himself is without complaint and denies any fevers, chills, SOB, CP, cough, edema, PND, increasing abd girth, orthopnea, palpitations.  However, per medical record it appears that patient was sent from rehab day PTA for concern of left upper ext swelling.  Was felt to be asymptomatic and sent back to rehab.  Today was sent to LCH given concern for his left upper extremity as well as bilateral low extremity swelling and wt gain with concern for possible CHF flare.


Of note, on day of d/c from LCH, patient had negative LUE U/S for DVT.


ED course:  In the ED, patient was found to be afebrile with temp 98.2, HR 64, BP 160/61, RR 16, &amp; O2 sat of 99% RA.  CXR remarkable for loculated right pneumothorax &amp; interval increase in airspace density suggesting worsening pleural effusion v PNA.  His WBC was nl @ 4.8 with slight left shift 75% PMNs.  BNP slightly elevated at 2200 (has been as high 20K in past).  Treated with Vanc/Cefepime &amp; diuresed with 40 mg IV Lasix.


ROS: As per HPI.

ASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN
Mr. Jimenez is a 78 yo male with h/o Hodgkin&#8217;s dz s/p chemo, T2m, HTN, AAA, CHF (last TTE 2086 with LVEF 50%, RVSP 45), a fib on coumadin, recently discharged after prolonged hospital stay for PNA &amp; complicated pleural effusion requiring chest tube placement, now returns from rehab with 20 lb wt gain since discharge on 3/09 &amp; 7.5 lbs since 3/20 &amp; increasing pleural effusion.  Increasing wt gain could be secondary to low ext edema. ?right heart failure 2/2 to pulm htn or perhaps diastolic dysfunction; however BNP not very elevated.  Patient&#8217;s albumin is only slightly below 3.4 as well.  Low suspicion for DVTs given exam with bilateral low ext swelling &amp; recent negative LUE noninvasive.


1.      Low ext edema/wt gain: Patient responding well to IV lasix from ED.
a.     Trial of daily PO lasix
b.     Strict I/O/s, daily wt
c.     Consider a repeat TTE, but recently performed 5 months ago so expect little change.
2.      Loculated pleural effusion:  With effusion enlarging, question if patient would be candidate for decortication/pleurodesis.
a.     Consider thoracic surgery consult
3.      ID: Will hold on further antibiotics at this time.  Afebrile without elev WBC.  Suspect CXR showing increasing pleural effusion.  Low suspicion for PNA.
4.      CV:
a.     Rhythm: Rate control with digoxin, labetalol.  Hold coumadin for elevated INR.  Restart when &lt;3.3.
b.     HTN: Cont Norvasc, labetalol, hydralazin, lisinopril
c.     PVD: Cont statin, ASA
5.      T2DM: Cont NPH 6 units BID + RISS


F/E/N:  No conc sweets.


PROPHYLAXIS:
GI: Not indicated.                
DVT: Coumadin
BOWEL: OBR
