CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Multiple acute and chronic medical issues,
including subacute weight loss. 

IDENTIFICATION:  This is my first medical visit with this
75-year-old woman with multiple recent hospitalizations.  

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  She has a long history of
severe cerebrovascular disease, with multiple strokes.  She
has stenosis in both anterior and posterior circulation. 
Past right carotid endarterectomy.  

In August 2095, she was admitted to BMH with a right
cerebellar stroke, complicated by a brief intubation and
pneumonia.  She underwent stenting of her right vertebral
artery and left common carotid artery.  She had subsequent
episodes of worsening speech, and was started on Coumadin,
with an INR goal of 2.5 to 3.0.  She is followed closely by
Neurology and may, at some point, undergo further
interventional radiology procedures, to be determined.  

During her most recent hospitalization she had some
confusion which was attributed to low sodium.  This was
felt to be the result of osmotic diuresis, and possible
SIADH.  This is being treated with salt tablets, saline
boluses in her G-tube, water restriction, and low-dose
Lasix.  No evidence of adrenal insufficiency.  

Since leaving the hospital, she has had ongoing weight loss.
 Baseline weight 170 pounds.  Weight in early September, 167
pounds.  Weight October 20th, 160 pounds.  Weight November 

28th, 141 pounds.  Weight today in clinic 146 pounds on our scale.  

She had a swallowing study on October 26, 2095, which
revealed no aspiration, but very poor bolus formation.  The
G-tube was placed in August, and has healed well, but has
never been used for daily tube feeds on an outpatient basis.
 Over the past couple of weeks, she has worsening trouble
with coughing, choking and sputtering, as she attempts to
swallow.  Her caloric p.o. intake sounds as if it has been
quite minimal, with a couple of ounces of potatoes or pureed
foods here and there.  She is drinking two or three can of
booster Ensure daily, but clearly not meeting her caloric
needs.  Today's visit was with the patient, and her daughter
(phone number 507.741.8042).  

Most recent laboratory studies, done 12/7/2095: Sodium 137,
potassium 4.8, chloride 95, Bicarb 32, BUN 22, creatinine
1.0, calcium 9.9, glucose 162.  

The patient has felt increasingly weak and debilitated, as
her weight has decreased.  

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Also remarkable for slight bright red
blood per rectum within the last week.  The patient's
daughter describes that she had a normal colonoscopy in
early 2095, at the Richwood Area Community Hospital.  The
patient's daughter will bring me these records at the next
visit. 

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Cerebrovascular disease, as noted above. 
2. Throat cancer in early 2060s.  Status post XRT to the
neck (may have predisposed her to the severe carotid and
vertebral disease).
3. Breast cancer.  Details unknown.  Will review at next
visit. 
4. Diabetes, type II.  On glyburide.  Further details
unknown. 
5. SIADH.  Will review hospital chart in detail. 
6. Hypertension.  Per Neurology, goal blood pressure 140 to
170.  
7. Hypothyroidism.  Details unknown.  Recent TSH normal.  
8. Glaucoma. 
9. Anxiety.  Being followed by Psychiatry on an active
basis.  This was apparently a large factor during her recent
hospitalizations.  
10. Possible recent anemia.  Has not been evaluated thus
far.
