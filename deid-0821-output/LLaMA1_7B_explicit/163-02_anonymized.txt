Dear Dr. Higgins,



Marion Gerald will be seeing you sometime in September for primary

care.  I was seeing her for various rheumatologic issues.  She

comes in today with ongoing pain in the left side of her face. 

Actually, upon exam, she clearly simply has left TMJ.  She has

been told this by ENT and I reinforced to her that that is what

she has and she will go ahead with a dental visit that she had

planned.  However, she has other medical problems which I will

deal with until she sees you.  At her last visit, there was a

question of PMR and she had "25 shots" of steroids but I have not

given her steroids and she has done reasonably well.  However,

she does have a history of a recent mild anemia but has diabetes,

hypertension and hypercholesterolemia and medications include

metformin, verapamil 250 b.i.d., Avapro 150 q.d., Pravachol 20

q.d., Bumex, Bentyl, Prilosec and Allegra.



Physical examination today reveals left TMJ pain which reproduces

her pain.  She had had no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.  HEENT

was otherwise unremarkable.  I obtained blood studies which

revealed a blood sugar of 208, abnormal LFTs with an AST of 62

and ALT of 58, normal ferritin B12 and folic acid, TSH of 8.8

with thyroid antibodies pending, urine microalbumin/creatinine of

14.5 and a CBC which had anemia with a hematocrit of 32.9.  A1c

pending.  A protein electrophoresis is pending and urinalysis did

not reveal proteinuria or sediment.  HBsAG and HCV are pending as

well.



I will be in touch with her regarding these results.  I was

wondering if you could see her sooner than September because of

these abnormalities outlined.  Thanks for letting me participate

in her care.



Sincerely yours,



Dictated By: Miguel Ames
