Neurology Resident ED Consult Note



Patient Name:  Trent, Shirley

MRN:  99210914

Date:  12/08/94

PCP:   Dr. Rose Irvin-Ly



CC:  right sided weakness

HPI:  The patient is a 70 year-old right-handed Dutch-speaking female with history of DM, PVD presenting to ED with right-sided weakness which started yesterday morning.  The patient's grand-nephew is translating, initially, then joined by Dutch interpreter; history is challenging to obtain.  The patient reports that since she awoke in the AM on 12/07/94, she noticed that her RUE and RLE was weak and numb.  She apparently had come to the ED about 2 days ago for RLE numbness and pain which has been worsening over the past 1-2 months, but reportedly had good strength on neurological exam, and she was not admitted.  She was given  a 2-day course of Levaquin for UTI.  She states that despite the pain in the RLE 2 days ago, she was able to move her RLE whereas since yesterday she has not been able to move it as easily or bear weight.  She also noted that her RUE was weak, and she was unable to raise it very far off the bed.  She was unable to walk independently since yesterday, and required full assistance of her son to walk to the bathroom.  She has had no facial weakness.  She has never had weakness of this kind in her right arm or leg, but had similar weakness in the left arm and leg in 2089 which completely resolved.  She states that she has had a mild right-sided headache since yesterday AM.  Since this morning, she has had nausea and vomiting as well (did not have this yesterday), and has not had any fevers or chest pain.  She has had SOB today. She reports having frequent BLE spasms, usually at night, and her legs become quite restless.

Speech/Lang: 	fluent w/o paraphasic errors; simple and complex command-following w/o L/R confusion.  Repetition, naming intact (via Suriname interpreter)

Praxis:	Mimics brushing hair with both hands.



CN:

II,III: 	VF difficult to test due to pt cooperation, appears to blink to threat on both sides., pupils 3    2 mm bilaterally to light, could not visualize optic disc due to pt cooperation.

When right arm was passively raised by examiner, pt was able to maintain posture for several seconds without drift or tremor.  Moves LUE with ease for overhead movements; difficult to test against resistance due to pt cooperation/understanding of task.  Unable to elevate RLE off bed; elevates LLE only slightly off bed.

Coordination:	manipulating objects without dysmetria LUE, less movement of the RUE.



Gait:	unable to test at this time due to pt feeling ill.
