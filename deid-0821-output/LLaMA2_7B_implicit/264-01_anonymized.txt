the attending physician.  The physicians dictated summary 

notes for each patient in the Emergency Department, and the

summary records only include the summary notes dictated by 

the attending physician.  In addition, the physician 

summary notes were dictated for every patient seen at least 

once in the Emergency Department, regardless of the 

outcome of the visit.  In many cases, the patients in 

summary records are seen multiple times during a visit.  The 

patient summary records are not a complete medical record.
