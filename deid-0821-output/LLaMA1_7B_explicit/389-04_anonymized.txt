___________________________________________



Impression: 89 year old male with past medical history of COPD on home O2, HTN, AODM, hyperlipidemia, remote CVA, CRI admitted with COPD exacerbation after recent admission to Ross Hospital with pneumonia.





Plan: 




1.  COPD exacerbation  -- Patient appears comfortable after nebulizer treatments in the ER.  He has completed his course of oral antibiotics and remains on oral Prednisone.  Will continue oral Prednisone and continue aggressive nebulizer treatments.  He may require higher dose of oral steroids and subsequent taper.  His chest x-ray does NOT demonstrate a focal area of consolidation at this time.



2.  HTN &#8211; continue Lasix, Losartan, and Lasix



3.  diabetes &#8211; Patient reportedly does NOT require medication for management.   Will check BS BID now that he is on oral Prednisone



4. Glaucoma 
&#8211; continue Brimonidine BID
