Dear Dr. Short:

I did see Irene Upshur for a followup today.  As you know, I did see her back in September where she was diagnosed with possible right-sided eustachian tube dysfunction.  Her blood sugars have been under reasonably good control, 88 and then 300.  She reports that her hearing has continued to fluctuate.  When questioned, she reports that she only used the nose spray twice since I did prescribe it.

On examination today, she otherwise appears well.  Ears are unremarkable.  Her eardrums are intact.  She has no tympanosclerosis or cholesteatoma.  Her gait is normal.  There is no nystagmus.

An audiogram done today does show a sloping high frequency sensorineural hearing loss, which is symmetric.  Her discrimination scores are 100% in the right ear and 100% in the left ear.

Assessment:  Mild ear fullness with dysequilibrium and blockage.

Plan:  She does take multiple medications.  It continues to be very unclear to me what her underlying causality is.  I would like her to use the nasal spray more consistently.  If she does fail this and this is not eustachian tube dysfunction, I would consider her to have endolymphatic hydrops.  This would respond hopefully to a diuretic and potassium supplementation.  However, she has taken multiple medications currently for both blood pressure including atenolol, Cozaar, Lasix, and verapamil.  I would need to clear to switch herself ??____?? therapy, I would like to see her back after consistent trial of the corticosteroid spray topically.

Sincerely,

Dear Dr. Short:

This is follow up with Irene Upshur.

Her last appointment was September 1989.  I did diagnose a slight high frequency hearing loss in both of her ears at this time.  I did note her right ear seemed to have slightly better discrimination.  This is a sloping highfrequency sensorineural hearing loss, which is symmetric.  Discrimination scores are 100% in the right ear and 100% in the left ear.

She has continued on her medications and her blood sugars have been well controlled.

On examination today, her hearing appeared to be slightly better.  Her right ear was better.  Her left ear was still somewhat degraded, 40 dB loss.  Her hearing in this ear has been worse than normal since this diagnosis in September
1989.  On questioning, she does not report any change, except for slight improvement.  The hearing in her right ear does appear to have improved a little.  It may be related to use of the corticosteroid spray in her nose.  I would still prefer her to keep using it, 3-4 times a day.

On her questioning, she reports that she has not used the nose spray in her right ear for 2 weeks now.  This does continue to be an issue for her.  Her hearing is very sensitive to any change in pressure, which is normal.  She will need to keep using the nasal spray, 3 to 4 times a day in her left and right nostrils, to maintain the improvement in her hearing.  I am still not very comfortable with the high frequency hearing loss on the right, which is the worse.  I would prefer she use the corticosteroid spray in her right nose 3 or 4 times a day in an effort to improve this hearing.

Her medications are still:

Cozaar  12.5 120 mg daily

Lopressor  5
(metoprolol)

Lasix       160 mg

Doxycycline 100 mg  1 x daily

Auranofin       50 mg  1 x daily

I would like to continue to monitor her blood sugars and her hearing, and she should have her next appointment in 12 months from today.

Assessment:  Mild endolymphatic hydrops of the right ear.  Hearing slightly degraded, but has improved since September, 1989.  Slightly better discrimination on the right.

Plan:  Continue to monitor her blood sugars and hearing, 12 months.

Sincerely,

Dear Dr. Short:

I had seen Irene Upshur in 1989, and I diagnosed a high frequency sensorineural high frequency hearing loss, 40 dB loss in her right ear, and 30 dB loss in her left ear.  Her hearing was slightly improved at that time, 10 dB in her right ear and 5 dB in her left ear.  On questioning, she had no improvement and her hearing continued to be worse.  I did prescribe the corticosteroid nasal spray for her to use in the left and right nostrils, once a day, 3 or 4 times a day to treat her symptoms.

On her questioning today, she reports that she does not use the corticosteroid spray at all.  This is a problem.  The nasal spray is the best medicine to help her ear pressure.  Her hearing remains degraded, 50 dB loss in the right ear with 20 dB loss in the left ear.  Her hearing is still very sensitive to changes in pressure.  I will be calling her to remind her to use this spray.

She has been on her medications and her diabetes is fairly well controlled.  She continues on her diuretic.  Her blood sugars continue to be controlled.

On examination today, the hearing in her left and her right ears appeared to be somewhat equal.  They are both slightly degraded.  Her hearing in the right ear was the worst.  Her hearing in the left ear was the best.  On questioning, she said she has been using the nasal spray in her left nostril.  She said she did use it in both nostrils.  I will be calling her, as I have been trying to remind her to get back on a consistent schedule of use of this medicine.  Her ears are intact.  I would like to continue to watch her hearing.

Her medications are:

Cozaar  12.5 120 mg daily

Lopressor  5
(metoprolol)

Lasix       160 mg

Doxycycline 100 mg  1 x daily

Corticosteroid  3-4 times daily in both nostrils

Auranofin       50 mg  1 x daily

I would like her to continue to monitor her blood sugars and to continue on all her medications.  She should have her followup in 12 months from today.

Assessment:  Mild endolymphatic hydrops of her right ear.  Hearing slightly improved, but continues to be worse than normal.  She did use the nasal spray 3-4 times a day in both of her nostrils.  Her hearing in her ear appears to be somewhat degraded on the right side.

Plan:  Continue on all medications.  12 months.

Sincerely,
