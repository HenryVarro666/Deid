CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Mr. Nicholas Xavier is a 73-year-old man who
returns to the Orlando Regional today for a quick follow up on his
left foot ulceration.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Glucovance 5/500 mg b.i.d. and Actos 30 mg
q.d.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The ulceration has not significantly
changed, but there are no new signs of infection.  He has been
taking Keflex 500 mg t.i.d. for the last seven days.  He denies
fever and his blood glucose levels have started to improve a
little bit.  His fingerstick blood sugar today is 145.

He has an appointment in Vascular Surgery in two days.  I have
asked him that it is extremely important for him to keep that
appointment for the evaluation of this ulceration and his
vascular status.  I have also reviewed with him that he may need
to be hospitalized if a vascular procedure is recommended.

Unfortunately, he does not have an appointment with Podiatry
until the end of this month.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  He will be seen by me again in a few days
after he is seen in Vascular Surgery.  In the meantime, he will
continue with all his medications.  I have given him a
prescription for Zocor 20 mg q.d. since the pharmacy could not
give him Lipitor that I had prescribed.

PROCESS:  The patient is a 73-year-old man who has a chronic
diabetic ulcer on his left lower extremity.  He has been on
glitazone and an ACE inhibitor for several months for the
treatment of his diabetes.  He presented to the ER on 3-18-91 for
a chief complaint of a large chronic wound of his left foot
within a diabetic ulcer.  He did not have any infection at that
time, but the wound was extremely painful and the patient was
taking ibuprofen for pain relief.  His glucose level was 300.  He
was treated with antibiotics, and the wound was cleaned and
dressed.  He had a follow-up exam in Podiatry on 3-21-91 and was
advised that he would need a vascular evaluation and a possible
arterial bypass for his wound.  He did not follow up with
Podiatry and returned to the ER today for a chief complaint of
diabetic foot ulcer pain.

The patient denies fever.  He has a new fingerstick blood sugar
today of 70, and he is taking his medications.

The patient denies any history of alcohol use.  He has been on
insulin for a year, and his current dose of Glitazone and
Acebutolol are 5/500 mg q.d.

He was discharged today for outpatient follow-up on 3/28/91 with
a new glucose level of 145 and a fingerstick sugar of 70.  He
also received Keflex 500 mg t.i.d. and Lipitor 80 mg q.d.  We
are unable to find a Lipitor prescription for our patient, and he
is on Zocor 20 mg q.d.

The patient does not appear to be in acute distress, but he is
taking a lot of narcotics.  His pain level is 9/10 with 8/10 for
his left foot pain.  He was also given a pain pump for his
foot today.

I have reviewed with the patient the importance of his upcoming
appointment with Vascular Surgery.  I also have informed him that
he may require a vascular procedure and a hospital stay.

I have also informed the patient that he is at risk for
infection of his ulcer and that his fingerstick blood glucose
level should be between 100 and 120.  I have discussed with him
his diet, exercise, and smoking.  I have given him a referral for
Podiatry, and I have advised him that he should see a
podiatrist at least every two weeks.  He needs to keep his
appointments for his upcoming Vascular Surgery appointment and
Podiatry.
