HPI:  82M w/ h/o HTN, CRI, DM2 and + h/o smoking w/ no known CAD p/w syncope and an inferior STEMI. Pt has been in his USOH.  This AM while shoveling snow he started to feel &#8220;unwell&#8221; c/o dizziness, slightly nauseous and sweaty.  He denied CP, SOB/V/diaphoresis.

Pt was given asa and was taken to the ED for further management. 


ED course: Pt was bradycardic but hemodynamically stable P59, BP112/63). He was found to have a new RBBB and new STE in 2, 3, avf and V3-V6 with depressions in 1, avl. Pt had no chest pain through out the entire duration, but felt generally unwell. Was started on heparin, lipitor, NAC and cardiology was called. 


Pt was taken to the cath lab and found to have 3VD w/ severe proximal LAD lesion, a diffusely diseased Cx/OM2, and a severe RCA lesion, which was felt to be the culprit. A BMS to RCA lesion. Pt was plavix loaded and started on a bicarb drip.
