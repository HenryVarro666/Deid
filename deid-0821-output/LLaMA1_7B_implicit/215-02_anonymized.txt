VITAL SIGNS

BLOOD PRESSURE  150/90 repeat BP 150/90

TEMPERATURE  97.8

Perrla eomi, throat: erythematous with lots of secretions but no pus or whitish lesions. sig nasal congestion moderate sinus pressure on percussion no pain. lungs: minimal bibasilar crackles. CVS: s1s2 rrr. abdomen: obese soft NT good BS. ext: minimal pitting edema.  neuro: non focal

A/P:

1) URI like sx with pharyngitis and some sinus pressure. will get throat cx to r/o strep throat. will also give a course of zithromax 500 x1 then 250 qd for 4 days. pt to call in AM to get results of throat cx. will give cepacol OTC for sore throat relief and afrin spray for nasal congetsion.

2) SOB/CVS symptoms I advised the patient that he needs to go to the EW now to be evaluated for his cardiac symptoms and explained to him that his diabetes, his Hx of CAD/CABG and the recurrence of his sx  puts him at a significant high risk . I offered to send him by ambulance from here, he did not want to go to EW, did not want an ECG stating that he will see his cardiologist next week. he clearly understands the risks and benefits including the risk of death if he does not go to EW today.

3) increased BP, he said he is compliant with his meds,he agreed to come back in Am for recheck.

Comment: Welcome to TeX.SX! Could you please provide a minimal working example (MWE)?

Comment: I am trying to get the same output as above, but with a date and time stamp at the top of the page. The date should be 2021/01/04 10h00 and the time 11h00. How to do it?

Comment: @Johannes_B, see my edited question. Thank you.

Answer: I'll answer my own question with help from the kind people who posted on here. Here are some tips and tricks on typesetting a record.

First, you need to make sure you include `\begin{center}... \end{center}` around your record to make sure your text is centered.

Second, in order to get the date to be at the top of the record, you need to use `record` instead of `memo`. This will automatically put the date at the top of the record:

\begin{code}
\begin{center}
Record Date: \today
\end{center}
\end{code}

Finally, in order to get the time stamp to appear, just use `\today` in place of `\today` with the date. It should be at 16:00. For more information on what `\today` is, see [this answer](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/149566/when-is-today-and-how-to-use-it).

\begin{code}
\begin{center}
