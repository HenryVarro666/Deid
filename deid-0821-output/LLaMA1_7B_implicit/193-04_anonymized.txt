EDVISIT^50294530^FOUST, FAY^12/14/95^FISHER, CARRIE
The patient was seen in conjunction with Dr. Dickerson.  I confirm

that I have interviewed and examined the patient, reviewed the

resident's documentation on the patient's chart, discussed the

evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the patient.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest tightness.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Briefly, a 65-year-old female with

hypertension and atypical chest pain who comes in with bilateral

chest tightness since 11:00 a.m. and stated that she feels very

lousy after taking her meds and daily has been getting chest

tightness since her discharge recently in which she was admitted

for weakness and hypertensive urgency.  The patient stated that

she feels like a "dead mouse."  She admits to some headache,

dizziness and continued chest discomfort despite medications. 

She had a negative MIBI and neurological workup and has had

significant adjustment for hypertensive medications.  Initial

blood pressure is 239/99 upon arrival.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension and reflux.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives with family.  No tobacco, drugs or

alcohol.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As documented per written chart.

MEDICATIONS:  As per medication list.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Afebrile.  Vital signs stable except for

high blood pressure.  Awake and alert female, in some obvious

mild discomfort.  HEENT:  Atraumatic and normocephalic.  Neck: 

Soft and supple.  Lungs:  Clear.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, and

nondistended.  Skin:  Intact, warm, and dry.  Neurologic:  Alert,

oriented, and moving extremities x4.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  IV placed.  Labs sent.  EKG is

done.  The patient concerned for hypertensive urgency given the

chest pressure and dizziness.  We will give ____ 10 mg IV given

the significantly elevated systolic despite compliance with her

hypertensive medication regime to include lisinopril, Toprol-XL,

hydrochlorothiazide, nifedipine, and apparently had a hard time

with blood pressure control in hospital as well.  I spoke with

PCP coverage.  Given the patient's symptoms and degree of change

of medications, we would admit for further titration of

hypertensive medications in addition, with cycle enzymes.  The

patient understands and agrees with plan.

PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  Hypertensive urgency.

DISPOSITION:  Admit to ____.
