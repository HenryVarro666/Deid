Dear Harry and Yair:



My thanks for your kind referral of the above noted patient with respect to her disabling claudication and of course she is not in a very happy circumstance.  As you know, she is just 52 years of age.  Her cardiovascular risk factors include type 2 diabetes treated with metformin and Glyburide, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and she is a former cigarette smoker but she has not smoked in a year.  She spends a lot of time caring for her partially disabled husband.  She has known and impressive history of peripheral vascular disease.  She has undergone bilateral leg revascularizations.  On the left side initially an iliac stent was tried but in January of 2063 she had a left iliofemoral endarterectomy with angioplasty and in situ above knee left fem-pop bypass graft.  This reconstruction is functioning well, as evidenced by pulse examination and she certainly does not have any major symptoms in the left side.  In April of 2063 she had a right common femoral and external iliac endarterectomy with a right fem-pop bypass graft to the above-knee popliteal artery using transposed greater saphenous veins.  There had previously been a right iliac PTA and stent.  She states that the procedure in the right leg was only transiently of benefit.  By last spring, i.e. a year ago she again had rather limiting claudication.  She says this is now worse over the past several months and she quantifies this as severe calf pain after just a couple of blocks.  Importantly she does not have ischemic rest pain and she has never had tissue loss.  Recently resting ABIs were recorded at 0.46 on the right and 0.8 on the left.  Her continued complaints led to a repeat arteriogram last October documenting a superficial femoral artery occlusion (??? length thereof - she did not bring the films themselves) and a patent albeit small reconstituted above-knee popliteal artery with decent runoff.  Understandably Dr. Adcock was reluctant about recommending further revascularizations.  She has sought an opinion here in this regard.  She has no known coronary artery disease and her general system review is notable for a prior hospitalization in 2061 for severe pancreatitis requiring laparotomy.  On physical examination blood pressure was 140/80.  Pulse was 70 and regular.  Carotid upstroke was normal and there were no major carotid bruits.  She has femoral pulses on both sides and the left fem-pop bypass graft in situ is palpable, as is the left popliteal pulse.  There is no right popliteal nor right foot pulse.  She does have dependent rubor on that right side although there is no tissue breakdown.



This is of course a very unhappy situation.  Further attempts at surgical revascularization in the setting of having both greater saphenous veins harvested and so forth is really not justified for claudication alone since the result can be anticipated to be not very good.  However I am not absolutely ruling this out.  I would suggest the following.  Her risk factor control is decent and she should certainly stay on the Lipitor, aspirin and Plavix.  Since her problem is claudication I would like Yair to institute Pletal at full dosages and give this at least a couple of months before we can say that she has had an adequate trial with question benefit.  She will get the actual arteriogram from the October study to me.  If it seems reasonable and the right superficial femoral artery block is not too long an attempt at percutaneous recanalization could be considered.  I will get back to you after review of the films themselves.  My thanks once again.  With every best wish.



Sincerely,





Daniel W. Iniguez, M.D.

Dear Dr. Iniguez, 




Thank you for your kind response to our situation.  I do have a request or two.  We have a new patient that we are evaluating for possible coronary bypass and I am trying to make up my mind as to whether to do a cardiac catheterization and a CT of the chest in advance.  This would be a male 56 years of age with a history of hypertension controlled, no previous history of CVA or MI, and no diabetes or hyperlipidemia.  I am trying to ascertain his risk for a cardiac event. I have no idea how to proceed.




Best, 



Yair Bennett





Dear Dr. Bennett and Dr. Iniguez:




I have looked over the arteriogram films.  The right superficial femoral artery is completely thrombosed and occluded and the left superficial femoral artery is not.  I have no idea what the block length is on the right.  However I can say that I did not see any evidence of significant stenosis or thrombosis on the left side.  As I have mentioned before I think a trial of percutaneous recanalization could be considered and if the patient has some response to this it would seem reasonable to try and revascularize her right superficial femoral artery.  She does not appear to have any evidence of atheroma in the left superficial femoral artery but I did not evaluate the left femoral artery itself.  The left iliac and external common iliac artery were evaluated and there did not seem to be any significant stenosis or thrombosis.  The left femoral artery was occluded.  I do not think it would be worth pursuing further evaluation with angiography of the left external and internal iliac arteries.  I do not see how you could do a surgical revascularization on the right superficial femoral artery if she was not doing well after the percutaneous recanalization of the right superficial femoral artery.  This would of course mean that you were going to put in a vein to that right superficial femoral artery.  The left superficial femoral artery is a good vein.  There is no need to harvest the left greater saphenous vein or the left femoral vein.  I do not think that the left external common iliac arteries need to be done at this time.  The left common femoral artery is a small caliber.  It would not be worth going into it.  I do not think she has any significant stenosis or thrombosis in the right external iliac artery and I think I can make a decision on her right external iliac artery based upon the arteriogram film itself.  This is of course my opinion only.  If I were treating the patient I would go ahead with the percutaneous recanalization of the right superficial femoral artery and if she did not do well with that I would do a surgically bypass the right superficial femoral artery with a vein or a prosthesis if the patient did not do well after the percutaneous recanalization.  There are no other major stenoses or thromboses in the arterial system.  I am not sure how to proceed on the coronary system but I think the patient could be treated by either a CABG or a PCI.  I am not sure which one he wants to do.  It is a little more involved with CABG but the PCI is not as simple.  The patient has a mild amount of left main disease and some other small vessels.  This does not seem to be too big of a burden to carry for this patient.  The risk is not too high.  He will have to decide.  I would be happy to discuss the details with you further.



Sincerely,




Daniel W. Iniguez, M.D.

Dear Dr. Bennett, 




Thank you very much for your kind help.  We have a young male 52 years of age with a history of severe pancreatitis in March of 1999 which required emergency laparotomy and a total of 4 units of blood.  He was admitted to a local hospital for this.  He was discharged home after a couple of days.  Since then he has had two subsequent episodes.  In June of 2002 he had abdominal discomfort and a CT of the abdomen revealed an abdominal aortic disease.  A CT of the chest was negative.  In July of 2006, an episode was diagnosed atherosclerosis, he had a coronary angiography was performed in July of 2006.  2006.  He has severe pancreatitis, which was found in the pancreat.  2006. 19. 	2006
