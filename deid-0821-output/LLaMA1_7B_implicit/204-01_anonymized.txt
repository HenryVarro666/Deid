Cardiac catherization showed tight LCx lesion (no intervention), distal RCA thrombotic lesion with 2 distal PLV that were ballooned and 3 bare metal stents:  1 in distal RCA distal (vision 3.5 x15) and prox and distal PLV (minivision).  Post cath he was chest pain free with resolution of his STE.  At cath, he was loaded with plavix at cath and received integrillin.  Post procedure he was B blocked with lopressor (HR in 50   s), given ASA, plavix, and lipitor 80, and started on captopril.   Presently, plan (per cardiology) is for repeat cath for PCI of L circ.   LDL was 84, on 80 mg QD lipitor.  Pt expressed desire to quit smoking     smoking cessation consult pending.

Cardiac Pump     Echo done on 11/08 showed an EF of 54% with no RV or LV dysfunction, no WMA and no valvular abnormalities.  Pt did not demonstrate evidence of volume overload.     he was hemodynamically stable.
