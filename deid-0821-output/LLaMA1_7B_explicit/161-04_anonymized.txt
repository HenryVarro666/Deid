HPI:   58 year old man with PMH HTN , Hypercholesterolemia, smoking. And PVD. S/P LE bypass was admitted to Vascular service with 1-2 day history of RLE pain, discoloration. Found to have occluded fem-pop bypass.

Did have a troponin 0.6 and some anterior ST changes. He was diruesed and placed on CPAP when he began to increasing respiratory effort and evidence of tiring. He was then intubated and transferred to the CCU. On arrival in the CCU pt became hypotensive with MAPS in the 40's. He was startered on peripheral  dopamine with good respone.

Studies

EKG-NSR, dynamic t-wave changes anterior, ~1mm ST elevation worse than prior v4-v5

CXR:  Vascular congestion. 







Impression and Plan:  58 year old man with PVD, likely CAD but no available ischemic work-up. Resp decompensation likely secondary to pulmonary edema in the setting of volume load. There is some question as to what to do about EKG changes and mild troponin elevations. No definite ST elevations, but elevation in troponin does seem to be too soon to be directly attributable to flash pulmonary edema and resultant demand. Follow enzymes,  heparinize both for ?ischemia and for PVD with sheath in place. As not lilely ACS, not emergent indication for cath, but he was scheduled for elective cath 12/08 and likely would benefit from expedited diagnosis. 



Pump - intubated, diruesis as allowed by pressure (JVP up, some edema of CXR). Started on peripheral dopa, but this is at least partially related to sedation. 



Rhythm - Bradycardia, no acute issues



Iscenmia - Demand ischemia vs NSTEMI. Follow markers. Likely to cath today where it is propble he will have 3vd and require CT surg consult.  Have request FMC records. 



Heme - FFP + lasix prior to cath. Heparin, 



Resp -  Wean vent post cath/OP





Prophy - Heparin/nexium/peridex while vented.
