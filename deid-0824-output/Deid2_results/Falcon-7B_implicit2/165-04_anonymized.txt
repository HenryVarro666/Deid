Patient Name:  REBECCA YAGER

MR#:  0887181

Date of Admission:  4/11/96

Attending:  Dr. Georgia Xing

Intern:  Branden Ocasio



ID/CC:    There's a herd of elephants on my chest.    



HPI: 	69 yo F with PMH of DM, HTN, s/p MI one year ago, now presents with substernal chest pain and increased shortness of breath x 2 days.  Patient was in her usual state of health until 3 days prior to admission, when she began experiencing unremitting substernal chest pain, nonradiating.  This pain was constant,    24 hours/day  , and    felt like a herd of elephants on my chest.     This was accompanied by an increased shortness of breath, especially with exertion, which the patient had not experienced before.  The chest pain and shortness of breath would wake her up at night, accompanied by drenching sweats and a dizziness,    I felt like I was about to faint.     Patient sleeps with two pillows at baseline.  The pain eventually grew to be so severe that the patient called EMS.  Upon their arrival at her house she was given 2 doses of SL nitro which improved her pain.  



In the TPG ED her vital signs were Temp AF, HR 70, BP 154/79, RR 20, satting 99% RA.  EKG showed a new Twave inversion in V3, otherwise at her baseline normal EKG.  IV heparin was started for possible MI given her symptoms and history.  D-dimer was elevated at 782. Based on these findings and her shortness of breath, PE-CT was obtained, which was negative for PE.  However, it did show multiple new mediastinal lymph nodes up to 9mm in size, as well as a 6mm nodule in the LLL.  The patient was given ASA, MSO4, nitro, and made chest pain free in the ED.  She was admitted for continued rule out for MI and workup of her pulmonary findings.  



ROS:  No fevers/chills. Does report cough, cold sores x 1 week.  The patient did report having slight lower quadrant abdominal pain, with some nausea but no vomiting, No hematochezia/melena. No increased frequency, no dysuria. No delta MS/LOC.
