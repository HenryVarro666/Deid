EKG: NSR at 74bpm, baseline RBBB, no ischemic changes


A/P:  60 yo man with metabolic syndrome presents with LLE edema and SOB with +troponin. Initially concerning for PE but ruled out with LENIs/CT scan. He does have a severe LLE cellulitis now with bacteremia likely due to strep.  His cardiac enzymes continue to increase suggesting ongoing myocardial damage either from silent cardiac ischemia or demand from fever/tachycardia.  Could also consider endomyocarditis secondary to bactermia.


ISCHEMIA
-cont ASA, BB, heparin, statin
-plan for cardiac cath to r/o flow-limiting CAD, although likely delayed due to bactermia
-check TTE r/o endocarditis
-cont to cycle cardiac enzymes
-follow EKGs

BACTEREMIA
-Likely seeded blood stream from cellulitis due to strep, must also consider enterococcus
-Minimal response to vanco overnight
-gentamicin x 1 dose to cover anaerobes/GN
-consider VRE, ?source
-surveillance cultures
-TTE as above

DM
-hold oral hypoglycemics for now
-RISS coverage

RENAL INSUFFICIENCY
-creatinine mildly above baseline
-high risk for contrast nephropathy given DM and underlying renal insufficiency
-continue mucomyst and bicarb, especially with upcoming cath
-follow renal function

NUTRITION
-cardiac, diabetic diet

PPX
-nexium, anticoagulation
