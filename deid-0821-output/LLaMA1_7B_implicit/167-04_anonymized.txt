-- hold verapamil sustained release, start verapamil 60 mg q8h b/c BP a bit low
-- substitute for Lipitor 20mg qhs per hospital formulary


Renal. Pt's creatinine has been trending up over the last year, ? possible chronic renal failure.  Also possibilty of mild ARF in setting of dehydration.
-- check UA
-- f/u as outpt


Endocrine. Pt w/ DM on metformin.
