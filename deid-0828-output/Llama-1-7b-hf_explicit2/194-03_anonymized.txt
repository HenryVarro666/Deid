Internal Medicine Admission Note

Name: Crawford, Patrick
MR#:  9021555
Date of Admission: 04.15.94 
PCP: Ehlers, Willa
Attending: Ward
Admitting Resident: Kimberly Ring

CC: 83 y/o man w/ known CAD presenting with near syncope

HPI:  
83 y/o man w/ CAD, (no stents), followed by Dr. Youmans, presents after an episode of diaphoresis and    upchucking    after helping his sister clean out the water in her basement (this happened Saturday am). Of note, he had one episode of diarrhea that morning. He denied any fevers or chills, or nausea or vomiting prior to this episode. When he started vigorously removing the water from the floor, he began feeling lightheaded and nauseated, and was told he was diaphoretic. He sat down on the stairs with assistance from the plumber, and    upchucked.    After vomiting he still felt dizzy and lightheaded. Ems was called, and upon arrival at the ED, he had another episode of diarrhea. At no point did he have chest pain. He did not lose consciousness. This felt somewhat similar to an episode of near syncope he had in 2092. 
In general, he is limited in his activity by his osteoarthritis. However, he walks up stairs regularly and gardens without chest pain. The only new medicine change is an increase in his norvasc. He has not been experiencing any palpitations, or shortness of breath. He denies any headache, visual changes, dysuria, abdominal pain, sore throat. He has heard that there is a bug going around, but denies sick contacts. 
ED Course:
Upon presentation to ED, HR 50, BP 141/62, 18, 99% RA, afebrile. Given aspirin, home meds, beta blocker held for bradycardia. Decided to admit despite negative troponins and no EKG changes because symptoms of dizziness when walking persisted.
