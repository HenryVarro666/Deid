Record date: 2079-10-02


71F w/ multiple medical problems, including dCHF, restrictive lung disease, severe polyarthritis returns to clinic doing significantly better for the most part.

Regarding her shortness of breath, she undewent a stress test which was completely wnl. She has also lost some weight (intentional) and states that, although she still gets short of breath with exertion, it is noticeably better.  She is being followed by the pulmonary department and is under consideration for a cardiopulmonary exercise test.

For her cough, the nexium has helped a lot and she likely has sig reflux despite the negative esophagram. The weight loss is probably helping with the gerd as well.

Regarding her arthritis, he L shoulder pain is much improved with PT.  Her biggest complaint at the moment, though, is her low back pain. She was seen in pain clinic for two injections. She states that the injections may have helped for 1-2 days but then the pain returned. She says this is her most limiting symptom. She is begging for narcotics.

Lastly, she has clear stress urinary incontinence, was cleared for a TOT sling but has now decided to push this procedure off until next spring.

A/P: 71F w/ MMPs including CAD w/ recent normal MIBI, diastolic CHF, restrictive lung disease, osteoarthritis returns to clinic doing somewhat better than before.

1)CV: Pt has diastolic CHF, w/ vol status cont to be improved on exam w/ almost no le edema on lasix (minimal hjr). She still c/o doe but even this is much improved. Etiology is likely multifactorial (restrictive lung, diastolic chf, obesity/OSA/deconditioning). Recent echo w/ EF 65% and DD. Recent MIBI wnl--no ischemia. BP well controlled and HR 60s. Cont to eat salt.  
-cont diovan 160, hctz 25, lasix 20, carvedilol, plavix (per family doc), lipitor.
-Close monitoring of electrolytes. Re-check today.
-low fat, low Na diet
-Check lytes, LFTs today.
-F/U with cardiology in clinic

2)Pulm: Shortness of breath likely multifactorial.  Recent PFTs reveal presence of restrictive lung disease with impaired diffusion. However, effort was sub-optimal and patient volume overloaded.  Also w/ significant obesity. Pt had recent sleep study confirming OSA. CT chest w/ non-specific findings and an "indeterminate" nodule.
-Am not opposed to cardiopulmonary testing per pulmonary, though sxs are slowly improving.
-Pt would like to discuss w/ pulm re: CPAP for her OSA. Will hold off setting up cpap titration until then.
-Repeat CT chest regarding pulm nodule--likely benign
-F/u in pulm dept

3)Endocrine: Pt w/ recently diagnosed diabetes w/ hba1c about 6.8. FS log reveals recent decreases in insulin and glucagon levels, likely related to recent weight loss.  Recent fasting glucose 104.
