HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient has a
new apartment.  She is actually in the process of moving. 
She recognizes that she is improving, and is very excited
about the fact that, during the course of the week, she went
out to Sel de la Terre, and also went through a movie with her
friend.  

Her sugars are still not well controlled.  She has been
liberalizing her diet, which I thought was appropriate.  I
did increase her morning insulin to 20 units of 30/70, and
suggested that she change from five units of NPH at bedtime
to 8 units of 30-70, taken with her supper, to try to give
her a little better coverage for her evening meal.  I wrote
a note to the nurse to actuate this change.  They actually
called me later in the evening, on page, and I discussed
this with them, at length, at that time, including the
rationale for this change.

She is not having any exertional or other chest pain.  No
orthopnea, PND or peripheral edema.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure is 135/80.  Heart rate
68 and regular.  Respirations 14.  Venous pressure 3.  Clear
chest.  S4, no S3.  No retrosternal dullness or rub.  She
has only a trace of ankle edema.

IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  Her verbal skills have improved.  She
got very nervous when I tried to test her cognitive skills,
and was able to give me the days of the week forward, but
not backwards.  I did not push her beyond that.  I did tell
her that we would need to check her TSH in a couple weeks'
time, to see if last increment had returned her to a
euthyroid state.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  I am doing pretty well.
I am getting stronger.  I have my friend here with me,
and we are both feeling a lot better.  

My sugars are pretty good.  I am still taking 8 units of
the morning, and 24 at night, but I am trying to get off
this much insulin.

I have a lot of pain in my back and I am getting it in my
legs.  It comes and goes with the pain, but it's been
going on for three or four days.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure is 135/80, and regular.
Heart rate 70.  Respirations 12.  Pulse oxygen 98% on room
air.  I did not perform a chest X-ray at that time.

IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  I do not think this is a heart
problem.  I think I would like to do a CXR.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  I am doing pretty well.
She is doing better today.  The last couple of days she
has had back pain, that goes all the way down her left thigh.
She has had a history of back pain for the last three years
and she has a history of left leg pain.  So I am thinking
that it is probably her back, and I would like to do a CXR
to rule out a fracture.  I also want to check her TSH, to
see if her hypothyroidism has resolved.

I will see her again next Thursday to follow up on this
problem, and to check her TSH.  I do not think she should
go to the emergency room, because she has no fever or any
other symptoms.

I would also like to check her cholesterol.  She has not
been able to get her blood pressure checked since last
week.  She has an apartment, and she does not have anyone
at home who can take care of her, and that is why she has
been unable to have it checked.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure is 126/76, and regular
with good pulses.  Heart rate 68.  Respirations 13. 
Pulse oxygen 98% on room air.

IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  I am going to do a CXR.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  She continues to improve
every day.  Today she feels a little more energetic.  She
is having no headaches or any other type problems.  I
have seen her back, and it does not seem to be a spine,
but I think that the problem is in her back.  

I would like to check her TSH, to see if it is normal.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure is 130/80, and
regulare, and regular pulse.  Heart rate 72.  Respirations
11.  Pulse oxygen 98% on room air.

IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  I do not think that this is a
cardiac problem.  I think that I would like to check the
TSH.  I think she may have some back pain, and I would like
to do a CXR of her back.  I also want to check her cholesterol, because it was elevated before.
