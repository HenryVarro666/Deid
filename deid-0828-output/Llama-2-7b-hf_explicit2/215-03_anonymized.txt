Assessment: 58 year-old man with a history of CAD CHF, and OSA who presents with weakness, weight loss, SOB, and ARF in the setting of increased diuretic use.   



Plan:

1.	ARF: 

-responding to slow hydration, will aim for euvolemia and hold diuresis and ACE-I. Gentle IVF at this time given tenuous balance between being dry and volume overloaded, will reassess volume status in the AM along with AM lytes

-hold lasix, ACE-I

-Urine lytes obtained in the ED difficult to interpret in the setting of diuretic use

-check Urine Eos (per attg)

-Renal U/S (per attg)
