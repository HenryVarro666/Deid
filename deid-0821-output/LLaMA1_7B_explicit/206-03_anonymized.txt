Comment: Thanks!

Comment: Thanks again! I'm trying to get this to look exactly how it does in my.docx file. It looks slightly different now, with a different font and font size, but I'm still having some issues with getting it to look like it did originally in the document. I think I need to figure out how to set the margins and the font size.

Comment: @Jenny, You've already asked two questions, and they are answered. If this new question is a new issue, then post a new question.

Comment: Okay, so I have one last question. I have this document set to single-sided, so it should be 4 pages. However, when it is printed, there are 8 pages. I think it is just a margins issue that I can solve. I'll post the document I've been working on.

Comment: Please don't post the same document to different questions. Post it once and link it to the question it should be answered in. You may also use the [edit] link on the question to add the additional information.
