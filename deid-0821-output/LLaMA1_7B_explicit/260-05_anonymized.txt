Internal Medicine JAR Admit Note 

Pt: Xander Vera

CC/RFA:  Pt is a 61-year-old man w/ CAD, DM, HTN hypercholesterolemia and recurrent atrial flutter admitted for atrial flutter ablation. 

HPI:  Pt   s cardiac hx begins in 2069 when he presented with chest pain and palpitations while shoveling snow and was found to be in atrial flutter. Pt was subsequently cardioverted to NSR. Pt did well post cardioversion. He was suffered NSTEMI in 11/72 in the setting of bactermia and Streptococcal cellulitis. Coronary angiography showed diffuse non-critical disease; decision was made to manage CAD medically. Pt was found to be in atrial flutter on follow up visit with cardiology. He was referred to Dr. Uher in appx two weeks prior to admission, who recommended radiofrequency ablation of atrial flutter. 

Pt underwent radiofrequency ablation of atrial flutter on 2/7/73. The procedure was was successful and the patient was transferred to the floor in normal sinus rhythm. He has no complaints and specifically reports no CP/SOB/palpitations.

\subsection{RN-generated Clinical Documentation}
\label{sec:RNGeneratedCD}

In this section, we present the data from a clinical document created by an RN. As described previously, we assume the RN will create a new clinical document with the same structure of the existing one but with random strings replacing the identifiers like patient's names and doctors' names. We also assume that the RN will replace identifiers with random identifiers. The RN will generate random strings in all the locations where identifiers are expected.
We also assume that the RN will create random string with age and location and gender. The RN will create a new random string with the patient's names, doctors' names, location, and gender.

We assume that the RN will replace random string in the string in all the locations, where identifiers. 
We also assume that the age and location and gender. 
We also assume that the patient's names, doctors' names in all the age and gender. The RN generated random string, age, gender. 32 generated strings.
