January 5, 2134  Endocrine/Diabetes



Present Illness:  

Ms. Mckee thinks that she will be discharged today. If so, we must be confident that she is able to draw up and inject insulin reliably. She will also needs prescriptions for metformin, 
insulin syringes (give her 1 cc syringes), NPH and Regular insulins. She apparently has glucose testing material at home. Will start with the following regimen, in addition to metformin 500 mg bid. She will follow up with her PCP, 
Dr. Robert Xenakis.



Before Breakfast:



NPH        30 Units



Regular      8 Units                  Blood Sugar under 101

                10 Units                  101-150

                12 Units                  151-200

&#183;         This is only an initial set of guidelines. The doses will have to be adjusted based on experience, diet, exercise, and illness.

&#183;         Goal is to have blood sugars before meals in the 90-130 range and blood sugars at bedtime in the 110-140 range.

&#183;         Check blood sugars initially before meals and at bedtime each day. Record the times, blood sugars, insulin doses and all food on the sheets provided and bring these sheets to your medical appointments.

&#183;         Call Dr. Xenakis&#8217;s office for any blood sugars under 70, or any symptoms of hypoglycemia (low blood sugars).

&#183;         Also call if blood sugars are often over 180.

Comment: I'm not able to replicate this. It looks great, except the last 3 lines which don't seem to have changed. I've used the `scrlttr2` package (the default) and `\documentclass{minimal}` and `\begin{center}`.

Comment: @AndrewSwann You're right, I forgot to copy over the last few lines.

Comment: I don't know what the problem is then.

Comment: @AndrewSwann I've added the output in my question.

Comment: @AndrewSwann I can reproduce the output with `\documentclass{article}\usepackage{lmodern}\usepackage{textcomp}  \usepackage{lipsum} \begin{document}
\begin{letter}{My name\\\address}
\opening{Dear \name,}
\lipsum[1]
\closing{Sincerely,}
\end{letter}`

Comment: That's weird. I don't know how to debug this sort of thing on my Mac, which is why I came here. But I'll try it and see what happens.

Comment: It looks like the problem is the font size. Try `\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}` and `\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}`. It also looks like you are not using `lipsum`.

Comment: @AndrewSwann That did it! I'm a bit surprised that the first thing to go was a font size change. Thanks a lot!

Answer: This is not a LaTeX solution (I'm not sure that TeX is the best language to do this job), but this is a simple python script to do the task.

\begin{code}
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
"""
This is a Python program to obfuscate some information.

Usage
----------
$./myobfuscator.py -o my_obfuscated_file.txt -d diabetes_clinic_note.txt

Arguments
----------
-o     output filename, the output will be saved into this file
-d     filename to read from
"""

import sys
from argparse import ArgumentParser
from argparse import FileType
import os
import sys
import codecs

# Parse the arguments
parser = ArgumentParser(description="Python program to obfuscate some information.")
parser.add_argument("-o", dest="output_file",
                    help="output filename, the output will be save in this file (mandatory)",
                    type=FileType(mode="w"),
                    default="my_obfuscated_file.txt")
parser.add_argument("-d", dest="input_filename",
                    help="filename to read from (mandatory)",
                    type=FileType(mode="r"),
                    default="diabetes_clinic_note.txt")
args = parser.parse_args()

# Read the input file and obfuscate it
input_filename = open(args.input_filename, "r", "utf-8").read()

output_lines = []
for line in input_filename:
    line_split = line.split("\t")[0]
    if line_split == "Name":
        output_lines.append("My name")
    elif line_split == "Address":
        output_lines.append("My address")
    else:
        line = line.replace("[redacted]", "\t")
        print line
        output_lines.append(line)

os.write(args.output_file, codecs.open(args.output_file, "w", "utf-8").read())
\end{code}

To execute the program

\begin{code}
$ python myobfuscator.py -d diabetes_clinic_note.txt
\end{code}

Comment: It's definitely not a Python solution; the OP already has the necessary tools, and this solution will not help them learn the tools that they already have.

Answer: \begin{code}
\documentclass{letter}
\begin{document}
\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
  \begin{center}
    \large\textsc{My name}
  \end{center}
  %
  {
    \Large\bfseries
    {
        \textbf{My address}  % <--
    }
  }
\end{minipage}
\end{document}

\end{code}

The following line should be in your preamble:

\begin{code}
 \usepackage{lmodern}
\usepackage{array}
\end{code}

Comment: I don't think that the OP is trying to obfuscate anything.
