Major Problems





Diabetes mellitus

/insulin dependent.  Saw Dr. Miles today. DM is under excellent control. He lowered Lantus by 5 units.



Squamous cell carcinoma of skin

/status post foot.  The patient had to have skin grafting following Kohs surgery for severe extensive squamous cell carcinoma on the dorsum of her right foot in 2118. Is followed by Dr. Colleen Quinonez in Milliken for skin exams.



Atrial fibrillation

tachy brady syndrome now with pacemaker and beta blockade.



Restless leg syndrome

Is dependent on daily narcotics for pain control, but has not escalated dose.



Family history risk factors

/high risk colon carcinoma.  Is up to date on screening.



Hyperuricemia

No symptoms of gout on allopurinol 200 mg daily.



Hyperlipidemia

Dr. Whiteman left meds the same last week, and told her that he was very pleased with her lipids control.



Anemia

CBC ordered today.



Hypertension

BP has been well-controlled in VA, usually in the 128 systolic range.



Dysthymia

/posttraumatic stress disorder. Much better after 6 months on the ocean in Virginia. I suspect she is feeling better with rate control on meds + pacemaker.



Coronary artery disease

No angina or SOB. After exam last November, I asked Dr. Nielson to see her regarding her rapid VR. He increased beta blocker and she developed what sounds like heart block in VA. Had a pacemaker placed and has been asymptomatic since then.



Hyperhomocysteinemia

Taking folic acid and b vitamins.



Permanent pacemaker

Dual Chamber Pacemaker placed 3/23 for bradycardia. P/G model # 5435, serial # 4712198, implanted 12/27/22. RAL 5167DH/20 Serial # SQ462162. RVL 0049EO/46. Serial # LX39426. Placed in Polson, VA 3/23 for bradycardia. Cardiologist there Dr. Quenton Qiu, 203-942-9207.
