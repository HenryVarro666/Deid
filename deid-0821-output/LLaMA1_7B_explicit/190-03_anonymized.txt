(959) 149-6104                                           10/02/89


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Nicholas Xavier is a
76-year-old male who presented to Orlando Regional this
evening for diabetes followup.  He denies any known drug
allergies and at present, he is taking Feratab 300 mg
t.i.d., Motrin 600 mg q.8h. p.r.n., Benadryl 50 mg q.h.s.
p.r.n., Zestril 5 mg q.d., glyburide 2.5 mg q.d., and
aspirin 325 mg q.o.d.  The patient has been followed fairly
frequently in the clinic recently for diabetic foot ulcers
on his right foot, between his 4th and 5th toe.  This
evening, he presents with worsening ulcers in that area and
also a new ulcer between his 3rd and 4th toes.  It has not
improved with good skin care and application of bacitracin;
in fact, it has worsened.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: He denies any bleeding with brushing of
his teeth.  He denies any palpitations or chest pain.  He
denies any shortness of breath or cough.  He denies any
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation.  He states that
his bowel movements have become darkened secondary to his
iron intake.  He denies any symptoms of frequency or
nocturia, no burning, itching, or pain with urination.  He
states that he has occasional elbow pain, which is relieved
with Motrin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: His temperature is 97.8 degrees, his
pulse is 88, his blood pressure is 135/65, weight is 141
pounds, and his random blood sugar is 159.  He states that
he did not take his medication today.  His heart has a
regular rate and rhythm at 88.  Lungs are clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  There are bruises noted on his
right hand and left upper arm, but he states that both of
these were related to trauma.  Examination of his feet
revealed his toes to be more reddened and somewhat shiny,
shinier than previous visits.  They were cool to touch.  On
his right foot, there was a new dime-sized blister on the
4th toe, and the toe that bordered his 3rd toe, and on the
other side.  There was an increase in the size on the toe
ulcer and also on the ulcer on his 5th toe.  Scant amount of
drainage was noted from the toe areas.  Mr. Nicholas Xavier
is vigilant with his foot care and has been so.  This is
definite worsening of his symptoms.  Posterior tibial pulses
are present.

ASSESSMENT
1. Noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
2. Diabetic foot ulcers on 4th toe, both sides, and 5th toe.

PLAN: Arterial vascular studies with Doppler imaging to be
done.  Referral to surgical clinic for evaluation of his
ulcers.  He was given a prescription for Xeroform gauze to
be used twice daily and dressing changes were explained to
him.  He was instructed to return to clinic in one month for
followup.

This is the second example of a clinical note that was automatically extracted by
eScription's clinical language processing technology (i.e., "automatically converted
into standardized clinical data format" and stored in a data store). Note that this
clinical note does not contain all the required fields that were automatically
extracted from it, as eScription's technology was designed to extract the fields
required for clinical data entry and not the entire note. This example also illustrates
how clinical notes are stored in a database (in this case, an XML format database)
and that the database has the ability to store and retrieve clinical notes and their
metadata, which in this case includes the date and time the note was created and
any comments that were added by the user at the time of creation, e.g., "This is the
second example of a clinical note that was automatically extracted by eScription's
clinical language processing technology."

eScription provides an automated clinical data collection system. It is built on XML and
relies on XForms as its technology of choice. XML has the potential to transform how
data is stored and shared across the health care industry, allowing health care
providers, patients, payers and other key constituents to work more efficiently and
effectively together.

eScription's technology is designed to address the need to capture and manage
electronic clinical data and to transform that data into meaningful information. The
technology is designed to work with any electronic health record (EHR) solution.
eScription technology is built with the following key components:

  1. Capture
  2. Validation
  3. Extraction
  4. Transformation
  5. Storage
  6. Query

eScription technology captures structured data from any source, such as paper, an EHR
system or other data system, into a single standardized format. Once in this standard
format, eScription automatically validates the format of the captured structured data and
transforms it into a common format. eScription is not just a "data extraction" technology.
It is a technology that extracts and transforms the data into a common format, and also
validates the content so it can then be used in a meaningful way, such as by a billing
vendor or by a researcher.

eScription technology is designed with a common architecture, so that it can be
installed on-premise or on-demand (e.g., via the cloud). In both cases, once installed,
the technology is designed to be very simple to use and highly scalable. This allows for
the technology to be used by small practices, to a very large organization, without
having to change its design or architecture.

eScription is currently in use at more than 100 health care sites, including large and
small, and is the most widely used technology in this sector. It is also being used by
many organizations to create and deploy applications that are used by a large
portion of their constituents to improve patient outcomes and reduce costs in the
health care system.

eScription is a privately held company that was incorporated in June of 2001 by
Brian Hitchcock, the CEO and Founder. It is headquartered in Minneapolis, MN, USA,
and has offices and/or representatives in Boston, MA; Chicago, IL; New York, NY;
San Francisco, CA; and Washington DC. The company's management team includes seasoned
technology professionals with extensive experience in electronic health records and
related health care information systems.
