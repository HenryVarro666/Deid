CAD...Now s/p CABG.  Sx preop were DOE, now no longer dyspnic even going up 2 flight stairs.  doing cardiac rehab. tolerating well, early in course, doing almost 2miles/45 min already.  Tachcardia on ToprolXL, still 80-90 at rest, 105 with exertion by design.  Advised that pulse may fall as conditioning improves.



Wt decreased 6# since last visit.



DM  Notes BGs 180 post rehab at 11am, 160s at HS, FBG~~120 or less.  On metformin 500/500/1000, NPH 30q11am/28qHS.  Discussed rational and controll.  A1C 8.1, above 7.0 goal.  Recc checking bg at 4pm as well, change am NPH to 7-8 am to cover lunch and dinner, and would increase 2U q 1-2days, watching tid-qid BGs and adjusting HS dose downward if FBGs <100.  Goal is no BGs <80, most <140.  Reduce frequ of increases as levels approach goals.



Lipids well controlled ldl=97



Claudication seems to be improving with exercise training.  Advised to continue.  Consideration for bypass only if limiting long-term progress.
