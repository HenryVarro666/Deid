Comment: I think you're missing part of the file (it ends with a line break)

Answer: Try something like this, but there are many more possibilities:

Answer: If the file is not so large to load all at once, you can load it in chunks of lines (which would probably be about 100 lines), then `\write` out to the file.  It would be easier if the lines weren't so long and if they contained only one word on the line.

\begin{code}
\documentclass{article}

\begin{document}

\newcounter{counter} % start a counter
\immediate\openout\myfile.txt

\immediate\write\myfile.txt{Record date: 2086-06-29 \\}
\immediate\whiledo{true}{
  \ifnum \thecounter<365 \relax \else break\fi\\
  \immediate\write\myfile.txt{EDVISIT^43294739^Finney, Indiana^06/29/86^GAY, G. VERNAL \\}
  \stepcounter{counter}
}
\immediate\closeout\myfile.txt

\end{document}
\end{code}

Comment: This works!  Thank you.  Do you know why there's an empty line between the two files though?  I can't find anything in the documentation about it.

Comment: @user2317948: I don't think there's supposed to be.  Maybe there's an error in one of your files.  You can always add `\immediate\write\myfile.txt{\\}`.
