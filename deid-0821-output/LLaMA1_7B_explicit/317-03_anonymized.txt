Dear Dr. Schmidt:

Your patient, Hannah Hendricks, was in the Surgery Clinic today.  As you know, she is a 52-year-old woman with a history of peripheral vascular disease.  She underwent a redo left femoral to anterior tibial bypass graft using basilic and cephalic vein from her right arm on May 3, 2078.  She has done well since the procedure.  She is now comes here complaining of left foot pain.  She had an ultrasound in the vascular lab to rule out a DVT, which it did.  She explains the discomfort as pain and burning in the bottom of her foot as well as her arch and over the dorsum of the foot.  


On exam, she is a well appearing female in no acute distress.  She is alert and oriented x3.  She appears grossly neurologically intact.  Her lower extremity exam reveals easily palpable bypass graft pulse in her left leg.  Her left foot is warm and well perfused and she has a very small pinhole ulcer over the plantar aspect of her left great toe.  This does not appear infected and I cannot probe to bone.  It remains superficial.  She has no other ischemic skin changes noted. 


I have discussed with Hannah that her discomfort most likely is due to peripheral neuropathy due to her diabetes.  She also experienced this discomfort prior to her surgery.  She is enquiring about starting Neurontin.  I have said she would be able to try either Neurontin or Lyrica to help with the peripheral neuropathy.  She will return next week for her postoperative graft scan to assess her circulation.  She knows to contact us sooner if thing worsen. 


If I can be of further assistance in her care, do not hesitate to contact me.


Sincerely,


Hunter Shea, MD

Dear Dr. Schmidt:

Your patient, Benjamin Hunt, was in the Surgery Clinic today.  As you know, he is a 15-year-old male with a history of peripheral vascular disease.  He underwent a redo left femoral to anterior tibial bypass graft using basilic and cephalic vein from his right arm on May 3, 2078.  He has done well since the procedure.  He is now comes here complaining of left foot pain.  He had an ultrasound in the vascular lab to rule out a DVT, which it did.  He explains the discomfort as pain and burning in the bottom of his foot as well as his arch and over the dorsum of the foot.  


On exam, he is a well appearing male in no acute distress.  He is alert and oriented x3.  He appears grossly neurologically intact.  His lower extremity exam reveals easily palpable bypass graft pulse in his left leg.  He also has a large non-healing ulcer over the plantar aspect of his left great toe and a 4 x 4 cm wound over his left dorsum of the foot.  The latter is non-infected and has no neurologic deficit or motor deficit.  He has no other ischemic skin changes noted. 


I have discussed with Ben about the wound on his toe and that the ulcer over his dorsum may be related to his underlying diabetes.  His toe appears to have healed well, as there is not much remaining dead space. He is going to be referred for vascular surgery follow up as I think we need a repeat duplex study.  He knows to contact us sooner if thing worsen.  


If I can be of further assistance in his care, do not hesitate to contact me.


Sincerely,


Hunter Shea, MD

There is a 4 x 4 cm open wound on his left foot with some dead space remaining.  We have been debating whether it is infected or not, but I am leaning more towards non infection, as there appears to be only necrosis present.  He also has an ulcer over his left dorsum of the foot that is 4 x 4.  This is not infected and also is non-ischemic.  He has no other ischemic skin changes noted.  We will be following him up on his diabetes in vascular surgery clinic.  



If I can be of further assistance in his care, do not hesitate to contact me.  I have referred him to vascular surgery to discuss his ulcer on his toe. 


Sincerely,


Hunter Shea, MD
