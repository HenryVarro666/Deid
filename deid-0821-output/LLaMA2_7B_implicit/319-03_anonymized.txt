_________________________                              



I have reviewed the patient's electronic medical records and have identified

potential errors, as follows:





1. The patient's last A1C was 8.6 not 5.8. This is significant given the

patient's age and the fact that it was obtained over 6 months ago.

2. The patient's last dLDL was 48 not 108.

3. The patient's last HbA1c was 6.9.

4. I agree with the plan of action as described, but would like to suggest

that if the patient's A1C is not controlled on metformin that we consider

adding pioglitazone in place of increasing the metformin.
