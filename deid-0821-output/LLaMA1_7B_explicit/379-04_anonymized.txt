69 yo man with HTN, DM, CVA in 5/93 underwent rehab and is now living at home comes in for follow-up care. He is under the care of Park Nicollet Clinic. I have recently refilled all of his medication. He has no complaints today. He denies F, C, N, V, CP, SOB, abd pain, B/B changes, HA and feels he is getting along well at home. His family helps him greatly. He underwent PT and OT.



His home care nurse wants a modified barrium swallow to see if he can be advanced off of thick liquids to solids. He only recently began taking TID metoprolol. He reports no problems with his medication.
