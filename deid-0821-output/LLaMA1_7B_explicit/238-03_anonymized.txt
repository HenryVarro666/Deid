### The anonymization method used

The method of anonymizing the clinical data was described by Edmondson et al. (2006). The method was based on the idea that a person with knowledge of the clinical data could determine the patients' personal data with less than a 10% chance of being right. The method was tested by Edmondson et al. on a data set of 500,000 records and it was shown to be effective (i.e. less than a 10% chance of correctly guessing any personal information). The method can be used to anonymize both medical records and medical datasets.

The method is based on the following principles:

* The patient must be anonymous and the medical records should not contain any personally identifiable information (PII) about a person.
* A patient's PII can be derived from the medical data and a medical record.
* PII can be derived when the medical record is connected to another medical record.

The method works as follows. A patient is anonymized by removing their PII from their medical record. A medical record is anonymized by removing a patient's PII from a medical record. The anonymized medical record and anonymized patient data are combined into a single anonymized dataset. When the anonymized patient data from the anonymized dataset are used to anonymize another medical record, a patient can be uniquely identified. This can be used to find the patient in the anonymized data set and to re-identify the patient's PII.

### Anonymization method description

In the example the patient's name is the only piece of PII and it is removed by replacing each string of letters and numbers in the text with "[redacted]". The date is replaced by "2080-01-26" and all the strings of numbers and letters and strings separated by `/` symbols are replaced with "[redacted]". The patient's age is also replaced by "81" and the patient's sex by "F". The strings are replaced by `"` marks. The strings in front of the doctor's names (e.g. "Dr") are replaced by "M.D." and the strings at the end of the names (e.g. "Dr.") are replaced by "Dr". The patient's age, the patient's date of birth, the location of her home and the patient's occupation are all anonymized. This is done by replacing the information by "37" and "F" and "Broadlawns Medical Center", and by "81" and "redacted" and "redacted". The strings are replaced by `` marks. The doctor's names, the medical staff's names, the medical staff's initials, their professional titles, and the professional titles of the doctors are replaced in a different manner. The doctor's names are replaced by "Edmondson, Bryan", the medical staff's names are replaced by "redacted", the medical staff's initials are all replaced by the letter "B", and the professional titles of the doctors are replaced by "Edmondson, Bryan". This is done by replacing the strings in the text with the strings "Edmondson, Bryan", "redacted", "B", and "Edmondson, Bryan" by `` marks.

### Anonymization method description

The next step is to add the strings of letters and numbers at the end of all the medical staff names. This can be done with a regular expression, but the example shows it being done manually. A regular expression would be more efficient. The strings of letters and numbers at the end of the medical staff names are added by replacing strings of letters and numbers with `` marks (i.e. by replacing them with " ` "). The first string of numbers and letters is added by replacing the first string of numbers and letters with "redacted", the second string by replacing the string with "redacted", and so on. This can be illustrated with the example below:

## Experiment results

Edmondson et al. (2006) tested the method on a data set of 500,000 randomly selected records from a real-world medical dataset. The dataset was collected over a one- and two-year period by the Vanderbilt University Medical Center. The patients' personal information in the dataset was anonymized.

Edmondson et al. (2006) compared the anonymity of the data by testing it on 200 patients from the dataset. The dataset was split into 200 medical records. Each medical record was used to test if any personal data in the records could be uniquely identified and used to find the records in the medical dataset.  The method was compared to the method of replacing the medical record with its anonymized version. In addition, the results were compared to the results when no information was removed from the medical records. Edmondson et al. (2006) found that the medical record could be uniquely identified from the anonymized version of the medical record 14% of the time. However, the method of replacing the patient information with `` marks reduced the chances of identifying the patient information. The method of replacing the information with `` marks reduced the chances of identifying the information by 71%. When the method of anonymizing the medical records was compared to the method of anonymizing the patient information, the data was not unique identified 94% of the time.

Edmondson et al. (2006) found the method of removing patient information worked well, but it was not completely effective. The data set contained a mix of patient data and medical staff names, and it contained both strings of numbers and strings of letters and numbers.
