KEKELA INPATIENT DIALYSIS ADMIT NOTE





NAME: Marsh, Carl

MRN: 99579205



Primary Care MD: Xavier T. Mccoy



Outpatient Nephrologist: Keith Tierney

Outpatient Dialysis Unit:  Sanford Memorial Hospital, S and T

Estimated dry weight: 61 kg

Dialysis access: left AVF



Reason for admission:    body jerking    since last night



HPI: 



74 year old Turkmenistan male with a past medical history of ESRD presumably secondary to HTN presents to the KEKELA ED with complaints of    body jerking    since last night.  The patient was in his otherwise good state of health when he went to his normal dialysis session yesterday.  The session was uneventful, and he finished dialysis around 7:30 pm.  Around 9 pm, he started noting un-controlable jerky movements of his jaw, arms, and legs.  He was unable to stand by himself, and had difficulty with any motor activity.  It was so bad that he was unable to feed himself, and needed help from his wife to do so.  The jerking continued throughout the night without getting better, and his daughter called his PCP's office today, at which time he was instructed to proceed to the KEKELA ED.  He has had a similar episode like this before in January of 2092, when he developed the exact same jerking movements after a long three day weekend when he went without dialysis (see note in LMR by neurology consultant).  It was deemed at that time that his myoclonus was due to    electrolyte disarray,    and he was admitted to EDUCARE-FARGO and received dialysis the same day with complete resolution of symptoms.  He has been symptom-free since that time.



He reports no other new events.  He denies any new medications.
