For example, if the content is:

"John Smith is a 35-year-old male who lives in New York City. He is a software engineer at XYZ Corporation and has been there for 5 years. In his free time, he enjoys playing basketball and watching TV."

Can you anonymize it like this:

"A person, aged 35, resides in New York City. They work as a software engineer at a corporation for 5 years. In their free time, they enjoy physical exercise and leisure activities."

Or

"A person, aged 35, resides in New York City. They work in the technology industry for 5 years. In their free time, they enjoy physical exercise and entertainment."

Please let me know if you have any other suggestions.
