	Reason for visit:
   A 63 yr old man with CAD and extensive PAD history s/p multiple peripheral PCI's admitted after elective cardiac &amp;amp; peripheral angiography and LSFA cryoplasty/PTA/stents.


	Interval History:
   Patient is a 63-year-old with long-standing right-greater-than-left claudication 
The Fall of 77, he could only walk about 25 feet before experiencing 
pain. Exercise ABI's revealed R ABI drop from 0.65 to 0.16 and L ABI drop from 0.74 to 0.24. An MRA revealed non-obstructive plaque in the common iliacs, 50% left external iliac and question of disease in right internal iliac; 40 to 60% common femoral and 40 to 50% stenosis more distally with 60 to 70% serial left SFA stenoses. He had a totally occluded anterior tibialis bilaterally with 60 to 80% trifurcation area disease and high grade posterior tibial on the right and occluded posterior tibial on the left. 
10/77 he was admitted with angina and ruled out for an MI. A cardiac catheterization revealed 50% focal LM lesion, mid 100% LAD lesion, 60 mid LCX, 50-70 OM2, 40-50 dominant RCA distal lesion with an EF of 65%. He has been treated medically without any further angina. 
. 
11/77 peripheral angiography revealed 40-60% LIIA lesion, 50-80 LSFA stenosis, 40-60 L profunda lesion, totally occluded L AT &amp;amp; L PT, R EIA 60% lesion, RIIA 40-60 proximal &amp;amp; 70-90 mid disease, totally occluded R AT &amp;amp; R PT, 70-80 R peroneal. The LSAF was treated with PTA/Xpert 6 x 60 stent, the R EIA lesion was treated with Palmaz Blue 6 x 24 stent. 
6/78 he was taken for peripheral angiography which revealed 30% REIA ISR, mod-sev bil IIA disease, R SFA 70-75, TO AT/PT and 50-60 peroneal. The proximal R SFA was treated with PTA, mid was tx with DCA/PTA 
Since then he has experienced exertional and rest CP occasionally requiring SL TNG with relief. In addition, he has experienced SOB with stair climbing but denies SOB with chest pain. He also has been experiencing claudication with left leg worse than right which has been preventing him from performing exercise. 

A ETT MIBI was done 10/31/78 where he exercised for 3 minutes 53 seconds. He complained of b/l leg claudication and chest pain and actually fell on the treadmill because " his legs gave out". Imaging revealed anterior, apical and septal ischemia as well as an EF of 49% and anterior and septal HK. Dr Barton put him on trial of Nitrodur, however, he developed lightheadedness and it was stopped. 
He was referred for cardiac and peripheral angiography. 
Preliminary Cardiac Cath reports reveals TO LAD with distal LAD filling from RCA collaterals (unchanged from previous cath). Peripheral angiography was performed and cryoplasty was performed to the LSFA for ISR as well as Precise 6x30 stent to LSFA and Cypher 2.5x30 stent to the tibeo-peroneal trunk. He arrived on Cardio. divis. in NAD.
