Patient Name:	Yusuf, Russell			MRN: 1423602

Date:	7/01/76					  

Consult question: evaluate for stroke/TIA

HPI: 61 RHM was sitting on the couch watching TV.  At 6p he decided to walk to the store.  When he got outside, he had dizziness (lightheadedness, not spinning), and staggering gait.  He went home and sat back down.  When he got up again, he was again unsteady and lightheaded.  When he shuts his eyes, he says he has "spinning" sensation.  He took meclizine which did not help.  He has meclizine b/c he has had peripheral vertigo in the past.  He says that the dizziness he had today was different from that.  He had nausea but no vomiting.  He also had ringing in his ears and "blurry" vision and a "tingling" in the back of his head with face flushing during this episode.



2d ago, he was watching TV and noted blurry vision.  He closed his R eye, and the vision was clear in his L eye.  He closed his L eye, and the vision out of his R eye was blurry.





ROS: Signif for 2-3 mos of hallucinations upon waking up from sleep.  He had some chest pain the past few mos and was diagnosed with musculoskeletal pain.  He used to have some episodes of L leg giving out 6-7 yrs ago, had unremarkable emg and muscle bx at Wolfe Clinic, stopped falling 3-4 yrs ago and developed bilateral leg pains now tx'd with amitrypiline.  Otherwise negative in detail including headache, change in weight, energy, appetite, palpitations, SOB, DOE, F/N/V/D/cough/chills, rash, BRBPR, melena, abdominal pain, change in bowel or bladder habits (i.e incontinence).
