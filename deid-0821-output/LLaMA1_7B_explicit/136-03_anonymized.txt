I have interviewed and examined the patient, reviewed the

resident's documentation, and concur except as noted.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 61-year-old female who

presents complaining of chest pain and lightheadedness for the

past 4 days.  The patient has a medical history remarkable for

breast cancer, status post mastectomy and node dissection, which

have given her chronic left axillary pain.  The patient states

that this chest pain that she felt is distinct and is

nonexertional.  It is associated with increased fatigue and

shortness of breath associated with it.  Today, states that the

dyspnea resolved after being given oxygen in the ambulance en

route and called her primary care physician who told her to come

to the Emergency Department.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for diabetes and

hypercholesterolemia.

OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY, SURGICAL HISTORY, SOCIAL HISTORY, FAMILY

HISTORY, REVIEW OF SYSTEMS, MEDICATIONS, AND ALLERGIES:  As

noted.  The patient is an active smoker.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In the Emergency Department, the patient

is awake and alert, nontoxic appearing, afebrile, with stable

vital signs.  HEENT:  Atraumatic, normocephalic.  Oropharynx

clear, moist mucous membranes.  Neck:  Supple, without

meningismus or midline tenderness.  Respirations clear with no

rhonchi, rales, or wheezes.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate

without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender,

oriented x3, normal mood and affect.  No cranial nerve

abnormalities.  No sensory or motor deficits.

LABORATORY DATA:  The patient had an unremarkable CBC and

chemistry panel with flat enzymes and normal coags.  EKG was

sinus with no ectopy, interpreted as normal, chest x-ray, which

showed postoperative changes but no infiltrate or edema in this

patient with nonvertiginous lightheadedness and chest discomfort

in the context of shortness of breath and generalized malaise.

PLAN:  Plan is for admission, serial enzymes, and risk

                                            EDVISIT^30921467^FONSECA, LINDA^12/18/78^ULLOA, CHRISTOPHER
                                            HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient reports that she had been
                                            diagnosed with cancer in the breast.  In particular, the patient states that
                                            she underwent surgery and radiation and has been under treatment for
                                            this since the age of 57.  As noted by the chart review, the patient reports a
                                            history of a left breast mass.  The patient reports that this has been
                                            present for the past 7 years since the time of diagnosis. The patient is
                                            now 68 years old.  In addition, the patient reports a history of left-sided
                                            breast pain.  She reports that this has been present for the past 7 months
                                            since the time of diagnosis, and she notes this pain as being more severe in
                                            the evening hours.  There is no radiation therapy associated with these
                                            complaints.  In addition, the patient reports that she has had an issue
                                            with shortness of breath for the past week.  However, this patient reports
                                            that this has never been associated with any chest pain.  As the patient has
                                            stated that she does smokes, she is noted to have a history of smoking 15
                                            years prior to the diagnosis of breast cancer.  In addition, the patient
                                            reports a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia.  There is no known
                                            family history of cancer in the family.  The patient notes that there
                                            have been no other associated complaints of nausea or vomiting.  As the
                                            patient reports being on a medication regimen, she does note that she
                                            has not been taking a medication for pain for the past 3 months but that
                                            she has been on a medication for anxiety since the diagnosis of breast
                                            cancer.  This medication is a beta blocker.
                                            PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In review of the physical examination of the
                                            patient, she is an elderly, thin female with a normal vital sign.
                                            She does appear to have a small left breast and she does have a small
                                            amount of edema present over the left breast.  In the physical
                                            examination of the patient, there is also a palpable lymph node that is
                                            noted in the upper right inner quadrant of the axilla.  This lymph node is
                                            not tender on palpation and she does also have a positive
                                            Lymph Node Examination.  She does have a normal cardiovascular,
                                            respiratory, and pulmonary examination.  As part of the neurological
                                            examination, she does have normal gait, normal motor examination
                                            with the upper and lower extremities.  The sensory examination of
                                            the patient did show that the patient does have some numbness with the
                                            left upper and right upper extremities.  However, the patient has a
                                            normal neurological examination.  Her abdominal examination showed
                                            that the bowel sounds were soft, and her abdomen was soft and nontender.
                                            She did have no signs of tenderness or rebound.  Her skin was warm
                                            and dry in the right and left upper and lower quadrant.  There were no
                                            signs of edema or erythema.  The patient's menses were noted to be
                                            normal in the past month.  The patient is noted to have no
                                            cranial nerve deficits.  There was also no signs of facial swelling and
                                            she had a normal extraocular movement.  There was a normal gag reflex.
                                            The patient does have a normal sensation on light touch over the
                                            tongue, the gag reflex was present in response to light touch, and her
                                            pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.  There is no
                                            associated nausea or vomiting, and she does have a positive Lymph
                                            Node Examination.  Her lymph nodes were also noted to be
                                            nontender.  As part of the neurologic examination, the patient did
                                            have a negative Babinski and a normal deep tendon reflexes.
                                            There were normal cranial nerve examinations, including her oculomotor
                                            examination.  In the motor system, her upper and lower extremity
                                            muscle strengths were within normal limits.
