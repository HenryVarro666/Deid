This is a preliminary dictation. 

PRESENTING COMPLAINT and HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This 

patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of hypertension and 

diabetes who presents with fever and chills.  He is four weeks 

status post revision of an aorto-bifemoral bypass graft, which got 

infected and had to be revised.  He has been doing well, but now 

presents here with a low-grade fever to 100.9 degrees F. (he states 

his maximum temperature at home was 101 degrees F., while he was 

taking Advil for the fever).  He presents for evaluation.  He has 

had no drainage from the site, and has been home on IV Nafcillin 

for the past two months secondary to his graft infection. 

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As above. 

MEDICATIONS:  IV Nafcillin, Lasix, Zocor, and insulin. 

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies. 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The vital signs include a blood pressure of 

179/85, a pulse of 91, respirations of 20, and a fever to 100.9 

degrees F.  The HEENT examination is normal.  There are some 

crackles at the left base, but the lungs are otherwise normal.  The 

heart has a regular rate and rhythm.  The abdomen is soft and 

non-tender, with good bowel sounds.  There is a right groin mass, 

questionably a hematoma, with good pulses however.  The extremities 

are well-perfused. 

LABORATORY EVALUATION:  The electrolytes, BUN, and creatinine are 

normal.  The blood sugar is 180.  The white count is normal at 3.7. 

The hematocrit is 29.  The PT/PTT are pending.  The urinalysis is 

negative so far, with microscopic pending. 

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient was seen by Surgery. 

The consensus was to order a CT scan of the abdomen, since the 

patient had a fever at that point, and so the CT scan is pending. 

Thus, the assessment was that this was a 58-year-old male with a 

history of a recent revision of an aorto-bifemoral bypass graft, 

who had been on two months of IV Nafcillin, and who presented with 

a fever.  Laboratory studies are done and cultures sent.  A Surgery 

consultation and abdominal CT scan were ordered, and results were 

pending.  The patient was admitted to the Emergency Department 

Observation Unit awaiting the scan, full evaluation, and 

disposition.  The patient was signed out to the 3 p.m. attending. 

CONSULTATIONS (INCLUDING PCP):  Surgery. 

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Fever. 

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient is 

admitted to the Emergency Department Observation Unit in stable 

condition.

PRESENTING COMPLAINT and HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This 

57-year-old male with a history of hypertension and CKD presents 

complaining of shortness of breath.  He was recently discharged 

from Silver Ridge with an IV line in.  The IV line was removed

                                     HEALTH HISTORY:

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  History of hypertension treated with 

Lasix and Aldactone, and CKD stage four on dialysis.  His 

lungs were clear, but he has been coughing.  He has had no 

chest x-rays in the past year. 

MEDICATIONS:  IV Lasix and Aldactone. 

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies. 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The vital signs include a blood pressure 

of 160/104, a pulse of 110, respirations of 24, and a temperature 

of 96.8 degrees Fahrenheit.  The HEENT examination is normal. 

There is some rales at the left lower base, but the lungs are 

otherwise normal.  There is some edema in the ankles.  The chest 

is normal.  The heart has an irregular rate and rhythm, and 

systolic ejection murmur.  The extremities are warm and 

perfusing.  The patient is cachectic. 

LABORATORY EVALUATION:  The electrolytes, BUN, and creatinine 

are normal.  The white count is 11.7.  The PT/PTT are within 

normal limits.  The urinalysis is normal for a urinalysis. 

The abnormal findings in the blood chemistries are a potassium

is a little on the low side.  The BUN and creatinine are normal.

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient was seen by 

Internal Medicine, who ordered a chest x-ray, and a CT scan was 

also ordered. 

The patient was admitted and put on an Internal Medicine 

ward.  The CT scan showed a large right upper lobe infiltrate, 

but it was difficult to see any other information because of 

the pneumothorax.  The patient was seen by the Radiology 

attending, who recommended that the patient have an open 

pleurectomy. 

CONSULTATIONS (INCLUDING PCP):  Radiology. 

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient 

was seen by Internal Medicine for evaluation, and the patient was 

admitted from the Emergency Department with a diagnosis of 

pneumothorax due to COPD.

five dialysees in his lifetime, but none of them were done at our

facility.  He has been admitted to this hospital twice, and once

it was because of alcoholic hepatitis.  He was also admitted to 

the emergency department twice for anemia and a fever, but the 

problems were never found to be due to a bacterial infection.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies. 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The vital signs are a blood pressure 36/13,

a pulse of 85, respirations of 20, and a temperature of 99.1

the knee were not enlarged.  The heart is palpating with a 

systolic murmur.  There is a thrill.  The abdomen is non-tender, 

with good bowel sounds.  There is a little edema in the ankles, 

and there are no masses present. 

LABORATORY EVALUATION:  The electrolytes, BUN, and creatinine

are normal.  The white count is 9.3.  The red blood cell count is

5.18 million/cu.mm.  The hemoglobin is 13.7 g/dl.  The platelet

count is elevated at 667 thousand/cu.mm.  The PT and the PTT

are elevated and abnormal (see chart).  The urea and 

electrocardiogram are pending.  The urinalysis showed 5 white 

cells per high power field.  The urinalysis is otherwise 

negative. 

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient was admitted to the

Emergency department for observation.  The attending physician

ordered a CT scan of the abdomen, which was normal.  The attending

physician ordered a lumbar puncture, which was normal, as was 

the blood culture.  The attending physician ordered an echocardiography

which showed a normal ejection fraction.  The patient was also seen 

by Internal Medicine, who ordered a chest x-ray, and the patient 

was seen by Radiology, and the chest x-ray was also normal.  The 

lumbar puncture showed that the patient was negative for tuberculosis. 

The patient is here for a painful lymphadenopathy of the left 

ankle.  The patient denies any pain in the back, and his lymph 

nodes in the groin or the axillae were not enlarged.  The lymph 

nodes in the groin were normal.  The patient's pain was not 

accentuated with movement or position.  He is here for evaluation 

and possible diagnosis of a bacterial or a parasitic infection 

of the ankle.

Radiology, Pathology, and Surgery. 

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  The patient is diagnosed as having acute 

lateral epicondylitis of the left elbow. 

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient

the pain, and the patient should return to his primary care 

physician in the next day or two for a follow-up visit.
