She feels fine, but had some chills and a slight temperature this AM.  She is taking azithromyin and is worried about the long term safety of the medication.  Has been taking it for a week, but had to stop it 3 days ago for 2 days.  She did not tell me why she has to stop the med.  She does not have any other complaints, other than mild cough.  Her appetite is good and she is drinking plenty to avoid dehydration.  She does not want to take lisinopril. 

                                                                    Medications
