Comment: You have a `\newifthenelse` macro in your document. That's not a good idea, as I explain [here](http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/26683/5764).

Comment: @Johannes_B  It seems like the answer to that question is different for each case. What if the `\ifthenelse` was only used in a `\newcommand`, for example. Would that still be a problem?

Comment: @DavidCarlisle: It's a problem in the sense that it's a macro which isn't defined by LaTeX (and which is not defined as `\newcommand`, etc.), but there are ways to avoid the problems. The question I mention in my answer links to one solution (a `verbose` macro). But I would not do that. Instead, I would use a package like `\patchcmd` to patch `\ifthenelse` and make it a `\newcommand`; this avoids the problem and allows you to use `\ifthenelse` as you like. (Note that in the answer by Johannes_B I also point that the macro was used as an `\newcommand` which could easily be changed by patching the macro.)

Answer: The answer is no; you can't do what you want with just some `\ifthenelse`s.  You can't just add `\ifthenelse`s and expect the code to work as you would like.  The issue is that you don't have control over what the compiler sees: if it sees

\begin{code}
\iffalse
\end{code}

then it will not do what you want, and instead it will just insert the contents of `\iffalse` (which will be the contents of `\ifthenelse` with `\thenelse` removed).

You can make your code work as you want by patching the macro `\ifthenelse` to be a `\newcommand`.  Here is one way to do that: define a command `verbose` which, when you type `\verb` (the macro), will replace the `verb` with `\verb\verb`.  Then in your code, replace `\verb\iffalse` (which you want to turn back into `\ifthenelse\thenelse`) with `\verb\verbose` (which you want to be the macro `\verb\ifthenelse\thenelse`)

\begin{code}
\documentclass{article}%%<<<your class name goes here,
\end{code}

\begin{code}
    \usepackage{verbose}%%<you can use whatever you like,
\end{code}

    \usepackage{verbose},

\end{code}     the command you want to
