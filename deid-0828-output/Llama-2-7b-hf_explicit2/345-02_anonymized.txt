Rheumatology Consult Note

Name: Mullins, Dolores U
MRN: 72841920

Location: 78Q-47-4
Consult date: 09/01/79
Referring Physician: Gay Langley
Source of history: patient interview, medical records
Code status: Full

Reason for Consult: bilateral LE pain up to knees
HPI:
77 yo F w/h/o type I DM and HTN.  At the beginning of this year, she began to have intermittent    burning    pain of her feet and sometimes her lower legs/feet.  This pain typically occurred on one leg more than the other, without an overall predominance of one side.  In the past month, she has had continuous, bilateral    burning    pain that began in both feet.  Several weeks ago, her pain worsened considerably such that she was having difficulty shopping.  Around this time, the pain spread up her legs to above her knees.  She also noted having difficulty putting on shoes and was told by a friend that her feet were swollen (she is unable to see her feet due to blindness).  Her pain continued to worsen until the night prior to admission, when she was in her bathroom and found herself in such pain that she was unable to get up to leave the bathroom.  A friend found her after 8 hours and EMS was called.  In the ED, she was found to have BP elevated to 190, Cr elevated to 2.8, FSG down to 51, and R-sided hydronephrosis.  Labetolol/diltiazem were given for HTN with good response, IV hydration was given with subsequent decline in Cr, and Foley was placed with resolution of hydronephrosis on subsequent MRI.   

She has never had    burning    pain of the kind that she presented with prior to this year.  Of note, she has had    years    of tingling without numbness in her lower extremities bilaterally extending to above her knees.  She also notes numbness of the tips of her R 2nd-4th digits.  ROS positive for subjective decline in urine output and constipation (1 BM/2days).  She denies fever/chills/sweats, recent weight loss, fatigue, hypoglycemic episodes, cough/rhinorrhea/sore throat, SOB, orthpnea, CP, palpitations, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria, polyuria/polydipsia.
