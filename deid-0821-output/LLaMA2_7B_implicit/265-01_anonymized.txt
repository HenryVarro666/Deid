PRESENTING COMPLAINT and HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This 
patient was evaluated in conjunction with a resident.  Briefly, the 
history is as follows:  This patient is a 54-year-old black male 
with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, who presents 
with acute, severe substernal chest pain.  This pain began 
approximately five hours prior to presentation, but accelerated 
within the previous one to two hours.  It is accompanied by 
diaphoresis, but not by shortness of breath or nausea.  The patient 
does have a history of prior CVAs, but no history of previously 
documented cardiac disease. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient is in 
acute, severe distress.  He is diaphoretic and somewhat pale.  The 
vital signs are as recorded in the Nurses' Notes but are stable 
initially.  The HEENT examination shows the sclerae to be 
anicteric.  The oropharynx is somewhat dry.  The neck is supple, 
without venous distention.  The breath sounds are clear 
bilaterally.  The heart shows a regular rate and rhythm with 
somewhat distant tones, without discrete murmur.  The abdomen is 
slightly obese and soft throughout, without tenderness.  The 
extremities show no discoloration or edema. 
LABORATORY EVALUATION:  The electrocardiogram shows an acute 
anterior myocardial infarction.  Other laboratory studies are 
pending at this time.  A chest x-ray has been obtained, though it 
has not been processed at the time of this dictation. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient was treated with 
aspirin and nitroglycerin en route.  He was started on a 
nitroglycerin drip, which was incrementally increased to 80 
micrograms per minute.  He was given morphine sulfate in 2 mg 
increments to a total of 10 mg.  He was given 5000 units of 
intravenous heparin.  He was given 2.5 mg of intravenous Lopressor. 
The Cardiology Service is here with the patient and he is being 
taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory for immediate 
angioplasty. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Myocardial infarction. 
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  As above. 
Please see the handwritten record for further details.

PRESENTING COMPLAINT and HISTORY of PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This 
patient has been seen in the Emergency Department of this 
Institution on numerous occasions, but most recently on 
February 26, 1968. He has had a history of multiple cardiac 
arrests.  On the previous admission, the patient presented 
with an altered sensorium, but without any focal deficit. The 
physical examination demonstrated bilateral ptosis, with 
ocular palsy.  The patient was treated with intravenous 
heparin and nitroglycerine. He was transferred to the 
Intensive Care Unit for further management.  The patient died 
the night of February 26th, 1968.  This death occurred without 
prior warning.  He was not known to be a diabetic or hypertensive. 
No evidence of cardiomyopathy or heart block was noted. 
The death has not been certified.  
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination the patient has 
had bilateral ptosis. He has a mild tremor of the right upper 
extremity.  The remainder of the physical examination reveals 
no focal neurologic deficit. The patient has had no recent 
hematuria. 
LABORATORY EVALUATION AND RADIOLOGIC STUDIES:  The laboratory 
studies performed have all been normal. X-rays and electrocardiograms 
have been within normal limits except for the cardiac arrest 
that occurred. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  No treatment has been rendered 
to date.  The patient has been admitted to the Intensive Care 
Unit of the Hospital and has been placed on a mechanical ventilator. 
The patient's prognosis is poor, since the patient has a history 
of repeated cardiac arrests. 
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient 
has been discharged.
