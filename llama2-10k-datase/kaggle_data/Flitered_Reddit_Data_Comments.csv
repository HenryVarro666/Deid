let put forward some problems and issues the first problem solved define sodomy and what acts are included presently blowjobs anal sex etc are illegal for everyone the major question arises whether allow fucking the assholes yes then should allowed just between homosexual interactions among heterosexual ones well lesbians having sex fine until they are not really penetrating anything you would wonder then how could called sex but they wish use sex toys for the same they are not allowed owning selling producing sex toys banned india sex toys are allowed india again the question arises should allowed just between homosexual interactions among heterosexual ones well even the act sex needs defined the present definition wont stand the point does not affect single law affects plenty laws commenting the issue would mean lot things and believe unless someone has clear idea what other effects that might have the existing laws she should refrain from commenting its good supporting opposing something but doing without knowledge inappropriate

 yet one seems reflect this practice but the post littered with crass humour this what most people here resort when they see something insult their favourite dharma their bharatmata their favourite politician you can read leela sampson being referred bitch here just because she dared pass and most people here hated the fact then foreign correspondent once wrote article slightly critical modi and yet again the right wing here bombarded her with abuses when rape gets reported from india the energy this sub channeled into how the fault worldnews for picking rape news stories from india you should understand the demographic the right wing the people who call others anti hindu and sickular their ego carries sense superiority accrued twice once when they are told how their religion the best and the second time about their caste being the most noble when they are exposed fact which strikes theose delusions their instinct label the other person jholachaap question his intentions anti hindu anti india perfect example who also the personal hero many here subramanium swamy 
 formatted all the tables thanks vim anyway copy your post and will delete the comment every second day there thread why educated people support that fount communal poison the bjp instead all endlessly circle jerking over subjective stuff wanted take slightly different approach and put forth some key macro economic indicators that compare data from nda era and the upa regimes even plotted graphs excel but imgur won allow upload excel graphs and have idea how upload these onto reddit otherwise ideas welcome also how does one make tables reddit copy pasting from excel again does not work the data indicator nda upa upa agriculture industry services gdp growth rates nothing much choose from though the upa seems have done well across all sectors how this achieved will cover little later indicator nda upa upa cad cad the upa performance looks horrible one could attribute increasing oil prices touched peak 100 barrel certain extent but only portion why the cad went down horribly indicator nda upa upa inflation wpi inflation cpi inflation seems have been horribly mismanaged the upa and this largely due deficit financing and pumping huge funds into the rural sector the form mnrega the mnrega was the larger picture actually bad for the intended recipients drove prices over and hurt the economy whole indicator nda upa upa fiscal deficit again how did the upa achieve the funding such profligate schemes such mnrega the food safety act the loan waiver deficit financing essentially spent more which govts usually more than what earned this also has the side effect fueling inflation and now come why believe even these numbers are illusionary absolute increase employment nda upa agriculture manufacturing non manufacturing services total the net jobs added the nda years compared the upa data for 2013 was not available not even comparable and this why believe the upa growth was illusory jobless growth factor the million unemployed people hitting our workforce every year and imperative that nation find jobs for all them another factor would have liked compare but data not available prior 2008 will leave out scope but just mention this the indicator gross fixed capital formation infrastructure the nda well know focussed lot infrastructure roads and the highway network being chief amongst these the nda added more roads years than years other governments combined without the govt massively investing actual infrastructure job creation and economic growth going difficult manage this not new either the upa mismanagement indira gandhi did pretty much the same thing she created import fueled bubble illusory growth that broke very quickly and fueled massive inflation windows opportunity memoirs economic adviser krishnaswamy goes into detail into how indira almost wrecked the national economy recklessly devaluing the currency and sending inflation soaring the late indira also established the trend socialistic economy not her father who piloted mixed economy ruthlessly nationalising every industry from coal banking wheat and imposing draconian restrictions the private sector indira also failed focus infrastructure and during her first regime cut down investment infrastructure after nehru who did very well guide the indian economy given his set challenges every succeeding gandhi dynast has been absolute disaster for the national economy the problem the gandhi congress way has now caught and almost every major party follows the same dead approach populsim throwing sops during election time and forgetting about even basic economics subjective opinion bjp see party that serious about building infrastructure that serious about creating jobs that while populist marries this populism with sense pragmatism arguably the only party right now that sees merit manufacturing being the workhorse the indian economy see how the bjp method has worked relative india course places like chatisgarh gujarat goa yes has failed karnataka yet has the resilience learn and apply lessons and not just throw some dynast scion continue the same tired old politics sloganeering empty tokenism and sops all won work without some hard reforms and this something the bjp has established track record and this why support the bjp source for the data the planning commission php data datatab edit seriously cross heart and hope die pinky swear level don care about points and self post doesn even give any points but seconds after posted this was wonder being brigaded the namo army edit somebody please tell how draw tables upload graphs here the post looks messy without tables

 this point let briefly consider short list constitutional challenges itact people who have fact consistently opposed section 66a the act opposed the political opportunists who are now advocating free speech like going out style rajeev chandrasekhar html parliament 2012 during debates amend asking for reviewed shreya singhal law student from delhi who filed one the petitions challenging the section read profile shreya singhal html her livemint here aaj kal bacche foot rajeeve rajeeveresolution pdf pdf mouthshut com one the petitioners and the only commercial entity with the balls stand for this right his challenge specifically intermediary liability funded the challenge himself say thank you keyboard warriors more details com union india taslima nasreen bangladeshi author and doctor living exile india after death threats when she published her book lajja she challenged fir against her filed under section 66a the act more details organisations pucl both ngos who have been challenging civil rights violations the for years 
 lot the drugs come from across the border too the drug menace needs stop has become major issue punjab and nearby areas not just strict laws but proper treatment and rehabilitation for addicts remember that the psychiatric ward female addict got admitted our surprise the rest the patients knew her turned out she was drug dealer herself she turned this life after her husband got arrested dealing support herself she good into the business but slowly herself got addicted 
how many questions they asked were related hrd how many were modi rss degree just figure this out and you see that wasn all about her performance minister but way for aajtak malign her publicaly ever since she spoke against rahul media hit jobs her have increased 
wtf this first want say that smriti doing good work shown papers but media have every single right ask questions about her qualifications and instead answering she playing bullshit feminism card posing this question women audience bet you same question asked from any male politician then there will such big deal
she always comes off she has chip her shoulder may rightly since she isn qualified hrd minister and want compensate for that and not even talking about her professional qualifications but just her track record having not heard how the anchor voiced his question but seeing irani clearly exploit the situation repeating the question give sexist tint and inciting the white knight crowd saving the abla nari instead being the empowered woman that she claims she and show the anchor his place asserting herself she shows that she just sock puppet minister seasoned actor voice her puppeteer words she always plays the abla nari card she finds herself losing the war words recently when goswami was grilling her about the iitm fiasco she shut him saying she was afraid for her life the congress agitators outside her house the hrd minister the country doesn have any security 
the kind coverage and insults she getting she has very bright future 
 smriti irani despite being woman says she has zero tolerance for non vedic education 
maybe modi should said bangladesh despite being woman muslim islam majority country country where male bloggers are murdered broad daylight for free thinking says she has zero tolerance for terrorism definitely forgot that 
what fuck randia going towards either people are too young have not gone through successive govts see where stand plain stupid when comes choosing between bad worst choice good for the bad one unless from dont know how the happenings affect him there are many things happening kerala didnt vote for the leaders there people largely decide who they want power name one party better than bjp today will take back this people were pessimistic during british rule soviet way socialism during congress emergency and what not those days are gone people have given their lives and this idiot arm chair pessimist dont know what she has done life get sad put the same faint heart people who unfortunately would kill themselves they fail exam sorry you sir are loser 
what made you think shelterer mass murderers would make for good did you fucking research maya kodnani and how many people she killed and the way modi protected that murderous bitch what about haren pandya course not fuck you for feeling sorry about yourself you have fucking right disown responsibility for your actions you had the brains read little before the election you would have least had the ability say you didn elect squad killers the cabinet 
nothing wrong looking upto someone hoping they will perform deeds that will good for everyone but when choosing leader mentioned that they are lesser evil this points deeper rot within the people you want change the options you have try the change you would like see one can move forward properly with their hands tied behind their back for leader think act and perform particular way she needs the right people move forward with just because one person cant make huge difference doing the right thing doesn make their action wrong armchair politics all well and good for discussion and planning but make real difference the right plans have converted into action just saying wont enough proper follow ups and reviews are absolutely necessary its not this new knowledge its just too many people pushing and pulling all directions for any meaningful progress made maybe find some way make things right not just for but for future generations who looking see how the ideals that are fresh their minds have panned out for the previous generation sorry for the rant its been long day not smart man 
 neha would have slept with modi which smriti irani did she would have been our sports minister smriti didn had win election even get degree and she ruling iim iit for cryin out loud and making policies holy shit for india

 wish dimbleby would have shut lees she can really waffle 
she police under her are taking ghoos from alcohol smugglers then how she honest look the whole conversation the minister wants put her mat for alcohol smuggling thats why she was showing attitude during the conversation 
 from haryana and anil vij one the most honest ministers haryana was addressing grievance meeting going question the officers that what was here opinion this ips was showing arrogance her senior and she got what was coming she have studied and became officer but that minister sitting there because all the hopes and votes people and doing the work which supposed 
 will not leave rekt probably hasn seen women who can defy his condescending hand waving get out his presence hope she doesn get accident something need more people like her edit looks like there was more action after the video cuts out anyone have uncut full video 
 here the link and has the embedded video decide for yourself why not link the full video y2ufrgwkwga incompetent police officer justifying sale illicit liquor and bullying ngo people who complained against when questioned the minister she says criminals get out bail and start again they cannot anything such incompetence the end minister mentions that she has similarly shrugged off her responsibility last meetings well this was delhi minister delhi thulla then entire media and this subreddit would supporting the minister and calling the police incompetent and arrogant now everyone talking about how honest and brave the police force and how they are not being allowed function incompetent and arrogant ministers 
bureaucracy the biggest hindrance development india and that incident one fine example why such the case watch the video minister was just addressing the public grievance and after mere questioning that ips straight insulted him and even said she cant shit because government sell alcohol 
dad senior ips officer with long experience says that this one the most major grievous cases politicians abusing police officer transfers are not uncommon but insults are extremely rare because has consequences where live sps any district would immediately lock the neta who dared tell ips get out and the policemen would give him heartwarming guest treatment the said lockups apparently not only that retarded thug got away with this transferred the ips some remote location where her carrier either ruined she die the hands his goons don know why cannot follow the japanese police model our police still built completely east india company army with minor changes japanese police utterly detached from political control and politician has ever been able influence any extent and their police free arrest rogue politicians without mercy the other hand india there hardly any politician that not rogue yet police either helpless completely under their control 
because you all have your pitchforks ready every moment hard for someone make you people understand you all are bit too much hater generalization because this all who you are everything that politician does say wrong very rarely see you people praise anything remember you all praised politician coz supported doping now you are ready understand this country democracy meaning the politicians are responsible its citizens the bureaucracy judges officers are not answerable people you can not question bureaucrat public because according constitution not responsible you but ministers public servants elected the elected leaders responsibility question and keep checks and balances officials public will question him her not the officials stop hating your politicians this will lead you all nowhere and shows you all not interested democracy but bureaucracy autocratic judiciary not loose faith your politicians because only they are answerable you not any one else what the lady ips officer did was absolute rubbish and what doing condemning the minister blunder she terms should have replied minister like that this not school she should have maintained decorum and her behaviour unfit officer what she did was absolute non sense just because she officer that does not mean that she right and just because vij politician should not ridiculed abused the one who will asked questions and his years report card can and will questioned people not the officers lay down your pitchforks and try understand things before coming judgement 
 take this from completely different angle management the politician the senior manager the junior manager the ngp people are the consumers the consumers are complaining cause they received deficient service the junior manager defends her position saying that the customer has not followed the correct procedure the matter has been escalated the senior manager the senior manager asks the junior manager why there has been deficiency service the junior manager again defends her position additionally citing that her hands are tied she does not have powers anything more the senior manager puts the blame squarely the junior manager saying that there lack initiative from the junior manager towards making sure that there good service delivery the junior manager takes one step further saying that the company was fault was the one which promised service delivery this the senior manager enraged and storms out the meeting saying that going recommend the ceo take action against the junior manager now that have take the political parties civil service govt etc etc out the story you can see that what happens every private institution across india including private and mnc would say that this attitude and even cultural social problem india where try and shift the blame others rather than take responsibility for get things done fixed 
 stopped reading after the rant warning but the bjp proved that they are not discriminate they are intolerant about anything and everything another note when this was being discussed one the news channels shania representing the bjp clearly thought that this was non issue and that the government had much better things pursue you could see that she was not even comfortable with the topic 
somethign note here that sometimes experience doesn always equal quality you could end with things like miscast misdirect etc and the industry never cultivated newer talent then there point having voice acting industry begin with mean nobody fucking expected cristina vee well that she now iconic and recognizable laura bailey ffs also only narrowing down their experience video games terrible terrible way judging how good they are acting for example raw talent may not always have portfolio but someone notices their voice and gets them gig that one gig the seed that starts their careers and before they know they household name also consider other sources and don just mean the big screen either why don you consider things like theatre plays broadway musicals and the like not everyone has experiences that are recorded dvd some these you have see live even know they exist there reason patrick stewart performances are said have shakespearean vibe them that where majority his experience draws from real unfortunate that ends getting typecasted more often than not waste his potential given what seen out him don narrow your interpretation what can that will only bias your opinion into thinking they not capable enough take this role and besides even they weren experienced they never get chance show what they can you never know how good they could been 
sushma swaraj can have decent chance provided she takes her game notch her image like that school principal she able project her credentials person who gets things done she may have chance being women counts her favor well 
good idea from the wife she said looks too cold there global warming could actually help tourism antartica 
 was expecting this for very long time general category the way here how theory plays out poor general castes who have not been fortunate enough get themselves included the obc category will keep rising this just the start forget the cursed brahmins there are plenty other poor general castes residing india governments will promise them obc reservation before votes these people will vote the government and when the government turn around they will fight back they won wait for years straight rebellions obc competition will keep rising till levels out with general candidates pretty close now castes who already have obc quota will ask for separate sub reservations like inside obc quota for them others will follow suit castes will start fighting amongst themselves asking other castes kicked out obc quota they are more progressed same thing will follow for after long time well people who are looking forward reservations will never try gain competence and get elevated the hard way why work when you could have the food delivered your plate generals know what awaits them don lament over reservation and curse the government reserved candidates try aim for the top from the very start unless others try the same thing these events will keep happening mother family came india from bangladesh after the partition they were horribly poor starving throughout the year living ramshackle shed best part that she was brahmin she never blamed anyone for her misfortune she fought back hard now working top level officer psu did her caste help her her perseverance did she was going through the news and commented that unless these people learnt fight back the misfortune and gain competence they will never achieve success their lives she didn need reservation these people don need either once you fall into the trap called reservation you never get out and the government digging deeper

typical elitist indian mindset forget modi mms this conception that only degrees from cambridge oxford harvard maybe even iit allow you think and talk strategic intellectual level might from 500 years ago but akbar was illiterate theory but reality was total military and administrative genius contemporaries who interacted with him describe him man considerable erudition who had gained merely observing others and introspection one them monserrate said and paraphrsase nobody who did not know him illiterate would consider him anything but and went away thinking was very learned and erudite closer our time and home indira gandhi who did not even pass college and yet was spectacularly competent when came politics even interacting and building bridges with world leaders though nixon and kissinger hated her abraham lincoln had little formal education and was entirely self taught man and famously called his own education defective even closer our time jayalalitha was what 10th pass for all her faults she was extremely erudite voracious reader had near eidetic memory and amazing recall facts and figures otoh you have your own mms who was used toy somebody with next educational qualifications like said this has nothing with modi mms but this arrogant attitude that deems anybody who does not have degree from fancy college brain dead could and people who were not only remarkably successful but would extremely smart and erudite despite even not having basic education why john glenn who died recently after such stellar career college dropout read churchill biography was aside from some brief flashes utterly shitty student and ironically for one the most powerful orators human history massive stutterer also like abe was pretty much self taught man this post seems inspired kejriwal tweets and the irony that someone who has decent academic record paper one the most brain dead asinine conniving assholes the indian political scene right now who talks shit and that something 
international politics not complicated you are making out gaining adequate amount knowledge these matters does not take more than few months for individual and you can bet modi has excellent team advisors help him out like ceos getting their smartest employees summarise books and reports you not need spend years and years learning the academic details strong grasp the basics enough function productively plus for all their educational qualifications the politicians you mentioned haven been strong leaders obama america highly divided and discontent merkel germany under assault from immigrants and she turning blind eye manmohan didn squat the years was given especially when was good finance minister 
should put any issue discussed caused politicians and editors since minority community fault absolutely less likely discussed any opposition parties central govt mayawati did really think dalits she would have say something but she just wants sleep vote beds dalit muslims bjp being government afraid hindu muslim lines that they would let people burn media taboo talk about fault muslim community just remember the incident when gaurav sawant tweeted during saharanpur riots news should present both sides journalists leeches him calling him names and demanding his expulsion from job opposition vote bank policy ruling party jumla and media hypocrisy responsible 
this such shame the casteism muslims not very well known and the govt turning blind eye this atrocity the worst but this nothing new politician wants anything for dalits the only one mayawati and she always vilified the savarna media 
good finally people are forced accountable operational manager she responsible for either finding the culprits stopping the loop holes she has failed means there needs more competent person charge not bhakt but don blame modi for personal corruption incompetence for downvote 
 people with black money have already got exchanged how without help bank folks now she says that valid explanation not provided she suspended turns out someone from the staff has made out way she the only one suspended done nothing wrong one will come out clean will require finding out the culprit your mom responsible for people working under her supervision she responsible just people blame modi here for everything demonetization fuck this venture nothing good going happen one incident personal level and you are ready throw the towel 
 dont know about other banks but lot relatives work public sector banks and after the first few days this scheme they always came back time but sorry for your mom offfense but the manager always held liable for branch mistakes unless she can prove who made the mistake correct herself dad chief manager psu bank and was called court just because his name was the file pertaining land mortgage where dad had role but since was the manager the branch had the courts for around months with higher authority comes even higher accountability sorry its just the way 
 people with black money have already got exchanged and those who did not have are standing lines and paying the price thanks corrupt bank officials apart from lack better planning govt corrupt bank officials which are good number are most responsible for failure demonetization btw why can true defaulter caught and punished hope your mother come out this mess she should not have face problems due greed some othet fcuking corrupt official 
wow she needs find the snitch instead blaming modi 
 they can tally amount over this sheer incompetency bank branch presume this happened because your mother new the branch and newbies are not given importance corrupt system don know what your next plan but can she below two things right away initiate inquiry right fucking now puling out every transaction detail would tedious process but there other way summon every doubtful employee separately and ask them questions apply for branch transfer once the investigation results are out matter what the result she needs another workplace and the branch needs another manager too turn have all sympathies for your mother and wish things favor her but what needs done the capacity operations manager start taking action instead crying all the very best 
 mom branch manager indian bank she been working days for months now because demonetization for managerial staff the day doesn end when the counters close because that simply the demand for new currency notes much the other work has done after the counters have closed which incredibly physically taxing for someone that approaching retirement and the conditions are the same for most people her position from what heard and they the ones that have bear the brunt this policy change yet the feeling was that people would have borne this something positive was come out yet more and more appears that this was massive misstep and none the supposed benefits look realised 
off topic but had post this experience punjabi who has travelled bit pakistanis have special affinity towards punjabi indians brother who looks persian all accounts always attracts pakistanis and iranians from far and wide who think apna banda hai like have seen them break supermarket queues come say him doesn matter when they later find out hindu any pakistani bus taxi driver open and friendly two pakistani guys showed interest which all came abrupt end once the words magar hamare islam mein and haan magar aamir khan muslim hai were uttered afghanis and iranians love indians general topic discussion that unites our contempt for pakistanis and love hindi movies the afghani driver didn fail point out though that but hindus have many gods sri lankans sinhalese don mix with tamilians even with tamilians and have special hatred for india obviously melbourne apparently the capital expats and the sinhalese that know are really sweet people except that they really really really dont like india after lots observations conclusion that india the big brother these guys think that india bully kinda weird feeling when you realise that india seen powerful some people who thunk will never support any match except against australia bangladeshis these guys are bongs before anything else have seen that hindu bengalis and muslim bangladeshis are really really fiercely proud their bangla culture and are frequently socialising with each other number occasions one these bangladeshi aunties have told why would you want leave india beautiful after talking her fully believe that part her family now living illegally india her relatives were the army fighting for the pakistani side she has special reason not india conclusion the indian subcontinent real kids india but especially north india who have grown being exposed all indians punjabis gujratis sindhis bengalis tamilians etc the people the language the culture the food will able find something common with everyone from the subcontinent all the more reason preserve and celebrate all our languages and cultures and while realising how incredibly strong are unity the other countries the subcontinent are too homogenous and are intimidating differences sorry just saw dangal sniff emotional jai hind jai maharashtra

don know should feel sad that woman being sexist towards women whether feel happy because she insulted politician

 want merkel succeed more than ever now but considering her track record europe needed some vision and imposing austerity joking about buying greek islands wasn really unifying leadership not merkel but the german press also kinda dropped the ball the refugee issue well let hope she sees that she and the rest don have leg stand and can get some serious work done with marcon but believe when see 
don even bother looking the commments obvious that one really has any insights this topic all you are going find are either people criticising merkel for anything she does ‚Äúshe has seeing how hard she fucked the migrant crisis‚Äú etc people that circlejerk praise her for being moderately competent politician economically powerful country which apparently how far have fucking lowered the standards for receiving praise the times trump truth she has made some good decisions and some bad decisions some her good decisions could partially attributed germany being powerful enough that things would have worked out fine either way while and she has made some bad decisions some which were choices dilemma situation where she would have received shit for choosing either way merkel such boring person you have strong feelings about her one way the other then would great time sit back and realize that you are most likely using her proxy for whatever that you really want complain about 
 mother does regret voting for them mother centre left political spectrum and had never voted for bjp before aunt gujarati are not and she had told about how bjp under modi had developed gujarat she said modi had taken new heights and all that anyway after years modi decided that will never vote for bjp again and are sick these cow politics though are vegetarians demonetisation failure our economy going down but there other party vote for congress under rahul gandhi not good 
well she can put beef her mouth she pretty hot
maybe she just wants reduce emissions that cause global warming some might say she the only one saying what needs done want save the planet 
 lok sabha election would surely vote for modi because simply there other choice may have right wing ideology but has better skills managing projects and getting things done than congress any other left parties has also revived the india lagging foreign policy but the state level rajasthan bjp big the bjp here just bunch asslickers chief minister and she had single handedly brought the state standstill nothing going here major infra project has been implemented her she least interested governance and more taking bribes and drinking beer you can meet her after 8pm centre would definately vote for bjp

 think stumbled upon some clues the perpetrators sent from friends ‚Äú had ananthamurthy kalburgi own father lankesh purna chandra tejaswi all these people they were all trenchant critics jawaharlal nehru indira gandhi rajiv gandhi but none them were ever physically attacked let alone receiving death threats ‚Äù threats have become common factor journalist gauri lankesh she has been shot dead 
 lankesh silenced before she could expose corrupt karnataka industrialists and politicians claims friend 4014391 html 
 one bitch dies the death bitch and every puppy crying with pain cant even imagine how lost these people are someone was fucking murdered and this what you say yeah get that you disagree with her political stand whatever but tweeting shit like this after she was murdered hope they realize how broken they are 
the article aap mouthpiece has two points rejoicing the death these opinions are trash and people voicing them should ashamed themselves and the people who jumped the murder including india make political point without knowing the motive the sly addition bjp cell chief tweet that was regarding defamation suit which she lost folks twitter tried use that tweet almost immediately threat despicable behavior 
 this just happened office colleague muslim hating patriotism spewing bjp supporter over lunch today brought gauri lankesh murder told delighted that she was killed and that she deserved horrified told him that people don deserve killed for what they say and that all have freedom speech which replied she was anti national she supported kanhaiya the nation always comes first fucking aghast that have share office space with people like him 
those are their personal opinions why care much about tweets now one really cares she died everyone using her death make gains 
 maybe she know couldn indian subs 
you know don blame the guy girl and have understanding that gaming for way unwind and play with friends and family out state also make sure that she does need that there for her though 
dude made the right choice when come home from work destiny how unwind although fianc√©e doesn enjoy just watching get unnecessarily sweaty while playing games she understands all about finding balance the give and take this also means let her her thing and spend time with her even means wasting arcstrider ult because she enjoys watching become darth maul 
 girlfriend pretty understanding when play games even came home from work with six pack the day zelda breath the wild came out but she doesn like the idea gaming all night don that anyway but still gets little frustrating when clock and she comes ask coming bed soon 
had who was big gamer was was awesome but after awhile our gaming interests began differ until the original destiny beta was released were playing together again and rekindled that initial attraction both had one another being gamers which was rare find then she made titan once the games full release came after playing strictly warlock through the beta was disappointed and had end things 
yeah that just shitty the last girl dated was well aware that avid gamer and even got into borderlands with and played through the whole thing but for some reason after destiny came out she stopped playing games with and had problem any time wanted get some destiny time despite seeing her nights week including every friday and saturday night was house cat sitting for her couple years ago whenever she was out the country for two weeks and she flat out told that could not being xbox her house while she was gone when asked her what she expected when was bored and alone her house since she didn have cable netflix the time she was just like don care but you aren gonna play video games there wasn long after that broke and totally brought xbox her house while house sitting anyway and just packed and put car before she got home had raiding 
 plays fairly casually but she likes watch she usually likes the lore and art more than the game though 
 complains that don hang out with friends irl enough she encourages play with them online instead strong relationships are built compromise and understanding 
when first met wife she thought was funny for grown man was back then play video games after some time she stopped thinking was funny and started giving hard time everytime booted xbox when was work she spent almost her time the house watch shitty shows and after was back home late the evening always needed some time off playing destiny let the steam out she started nagging that always occupying the set even though had second the bedroom and that she was too bored spend time the bedroom while not sleeping tried explain her that need for practically only hobby but she wouldn understand and kept fighting thought should play smart and aggressive after that stopped playing for week but decided out with buddies and have some beers almost every night guess what now she finds hobby totally reasonable and has problem giving the space need day play video games 
 missus understands love gaming just just makes sure keep priorities balanced parent have make sure not over binge games but because she gets passion even doesn make sense her more ready and willing skip game night with the clan she asks spend time with her your partner doesn need like what you like respect 
was once living with girlfriend who didn have much tolerance for video games the time went along with because was young and unsure what else was out there needless say didn work out and blamed myself the time fast forward years and now engaged beautiful fianc√© who actually enjoys playing with she may not raid ready for few months but least she has fun with 
reading these makes happy that found girl who will play destiny with made sure put ring her before she could run away always made sure any girl dated knew upfront gamer first significant other second lol 
the girl doesn care that plays video games she just wants spend time with him asking doing anything her way saying they should date hang out 
sucks not have partner wife bought xbox one day one and pre ordered the and she never picked controller her life spend all the time not playing working the house with her and she understands chill and decompress time hell for launch got home from work with beer coffee and pizza waiting for next controller when you find good spouse just don take for granted feel for this guy 
this problem never goes away and only gets worse with marriage and kids the wife often lets play she used togo another room that not easy the moment instead wait till she goes bed and then just get quizzed about why was late that said out training lot and just had another baby but this guy totally made the right choice 
 former girlfriend made hard play destiny couldn play her house for many reasons would stay place and play and she would make the phone with her the whole time played even her and weren taking she wouldn drive come place because her many reasons current girlfriend totally gets the concept that can the same house together all weekend but don have doing the exact same thing all weekend she actually prefers having some alone time when are together works out can play destiny while she chills the bedroom with the couch while game she wants shop with her sister for few hours not big deal want play games clean goto bed later than her problems 
 ive been with this girl for like months are our 30s she has kids aged and they are gamer kids and have ps4 360 and wii got the into destiny and will get him for his bday mega pokemon fan and the baby just eats and stuff live like hour drive apart here weekends the sunday before released preordered the game and gave her the receipt she delivered release day with dinner she even said should have weekend isolate myself and play shes cool with gaming far but its early ive had broads give grief over the past they dont accept disappear 
 first years dating wife never touched game then halo came out years later she still says tricked her into falling love with non gamer now she begrudgingly supports destiny addiction 
guess you could say she puts sunnies stranger him yeeaaaahhh 
how can she wink drops dead 
may she though they mixed cow urine wait 
 according reports the bjp leader slapped her because she did not condone the girl enjoying tea with muslim friend isn shocking anymore just your friendly neighborhood bjp goondagardi

 also disregarded literally everything was taught since birth about how gods are wrong for doing whatever they wanted the expense the mortals ‚Äúbut ‚Äô god ‚Äù you‚Äô shitty character who flipped quickly that ‚Äô unbelievable tilted far fast and get that ‚Äô for the sake story telling but come went from time disregarding everything ‚Äô ever been taught and basically saying his mother can eat shit because she wasn‚Äô god was super mommas boy and that type stuff just easily broke the immersion 
 fairly certain that laufey placed that palm print before jotunheim was sealed and before she ever met kratos its also stretch assume that she planned the aesir downfall based her knowing the future interesting question don know she loved kratos was using him for his seed some combination them both even planned would have been her and the surviving giants collectively she obviously did not create the shrine within jotunheim her own don know the time line freya spell baldur but considering that she was physical contact the time imagine this had before her falling out with odin brok says during one his dialogs that try dead but details regarding his death show anywhere might early assume that hes actually gone you can also add odin corrupts sigrun and company the before the game section 
 think remember mimir mentioning that freya being queen the valkyrie was part their dowry which would mean she only became the queen after she married odin
after trip jotunheim mimir reveals that freya visited him kratos house when they were out for hunting she wanted know where her wings are possibly for revenge 
 would need double check but believe the reason odin married freya was get access her powerful magic eventually she starts trust him and teaches him her magic kicks her the curb after getting what wants and proceeds put that spell her pretty much she cant retaliate anyway 
 think freya puts that spell baldur because his death starts ragnarok she sends her minions goes herself and collects all elements from all the realms and builds spell protect baldur from harm from any them she overlooks mistletoe and realizes that she missed after the spell complete which why she puts forgetting spell everyone involved afterwards one but her knows about the mistletoe this atleast from some norse lore looked not sure how true this the game lore 
not confirmed game but norse mythology says for the spell she cast baldur she essentially asked everything the world not hurt her boy but mistletoe didn agree this hence the only thing able hurt him mistletoe badass

very well articulated can‚Äô agree more think the problem rooted the ignorance and bigotry the average indian voter who claims all knowing and perfect despite being the opposite what she claims stands for what find appalling the rampant intolerance the average indian bhakt voter has for anyone who centrist otherwise marginally left leaning these continued calls for anyone not bent the right leave the country just indicative this intolerance that has gone unchecked the country ever since the bjp came the center stage much regulation individual opinions and comments the internet contrary the spirit liberal social media seems rather ironic that also the need the hour today maintain truly liberal and free internet that permits anyone with any political view freely share their opinions and views the internet today 
imagine common man doing that theatre she would beaten the bhakts 
yet another revelation baldur never really comments why his mother freya doesn really attack kratos even when she desperately trying stop him throughout the entire fight baldur never really comments how kratos and freya obviously know each other that would surely weird why earth would giant from norse mythology know greek god however makes complete sense that baldur wouldn think twice about this because him both freya and kratos are giants course they know one another

 she said she would willing whatever took protect the american people that does not specify torture nor does that resemble strong defense torture her comments that indian show was unfortunately vague and seems like she would pro torture order protect the american people she seems not sure torture works was voter would want know more about her stance torture her votes for closing guantanamo bay does not mean that she against torture just means she wants close guantanamo bay

what really ticked off that actually interrupts her make this joke she was talking when cracked his joke not even pause reply after she finished talking also had enough these papu jokes potshots are never funny 
 house bit schizophrenic about this maid eats anything that been cooked the house but she eats different set plates well least nobody monitoring how much that progress sorts guess 
 some cases may not untouchability where used live earlier school days large part the labor were heavy smokers paan chewers etc incidence also was very high talking about east area due small children the house the utensils were separate that said the cook was lady from the called untouchable classes and she used eat and drink the same utensils 
few people here are commenting that matter preference and yes having separate set utensils can matter preference but the big question here think the why you have fancy set utensils that you use when guests come over can described preference because the why this question would that you don want use fancy plate for your everyday eating and have sometime special for guests but when you keep separate set utensils for your workers maids domestic helps etc can not described preference because the why that question would the underlying belief that they are somehow lower than does anyone here disagree that the reason behind keeping separate plate something different than this someone has also mentioned that they might not comfortable sharing the same utensils fair enough your utensils but tell why you are not comfortable when you say that someone can not sit the same level chair that you and must sit the floor not matter preference when you say that you won eat with certain person that can not matter preference again one can and should able force you eat together with someone that why say the why important you simply don like that person not eating together won shouldn big deal however you won eat together with that person because she belongs different caste that discrimination have not mentioned any caste political party here also not claiming whether not the political party question actually exercises those discriminatory behaviour also not saying anything whether their rival party isn guilty the said behaviour response those people who are dismissing this non issue 
not that person but our house have separate cups plates and bowls for each don eat parents plate and they don eat using mine maid has her own steel utensils just like the rest she eats out meals our house obviously have give her full set utensils all have our names engraved into the plate kind finicky about food and drink don particularly like sharing utensils have separate set cups and saucers for different people well you know what mean the really expensive nicer china saved for special guests and the slightly less expensive china for regular house guests don see why this wrong 
technically all pakistanis are not terrorists logical fallacy grammatical error since surely some people pakistan all countries actually are terrorists she probably meant not all pakistanis are terrorists still really shit situation 
 agree that media should way more nuanced its reporting kashmir however the article itself quite biased against india the reporter says that the media has legitimised hindutva treating indian media monolithic entity when anything but large section openly criticised the move and continues reporting kashmir too war like situation bound push back lesser concerns like rafale not evidence that media bjp propaganda machine journalistic standards definitely need higher but most the indian media going report things from the indian perspective rather than the pakistani perspective obvious that the things that give higher trp are going over reported natural that indian media will give more credence indian claims than pakistani these circumstances the end the day most the mainstream news channels care only about trp realise this one only has watch debate any news channel fucking joke indian media needs introspect and raise its journalistic standards and provide more credible sources for their claims however claiming the entire indian media bjp propaganda machine simplistic and erroneous assertion painting all indian media with this broad brush the reporter trying discredit any its stories the future polis great organisation however evidenced from this article and all the others posted their own website they have their own agenda regarding kashmir ironic that she asserts that the indian media should have more nuanced approach towards kashmir which strongly agree with and then takes such simplistic view towards the entirety indian media further her organisation agenda 
are sure she isn our finance minister maybe silence minister 
 grandparents let the housemaid eat along with them grandmother has believed this form treatment since many years and everyone our family believes this too she literally gets thaali with all fresh food grandmother makes sure prepare the food just before she finishes her work that she gets hot and fresh food over the years she has worked with she has never ate cold stale food have something our plate she gets too even eat one roti she gets three because she works hard and has more appetite discrimination matter how many maids have had over the years they always sat the table along with really love and truly respect grandparents for this and everything else they and believe really hope everyone could like that

 compare this with donald trump who hates media and calls enemy the state who calls popular media houses fake news holds regular press conferences and has system press briefings the white house tbf trump does not answer uncomfortable questions and regularly tells the askers shut kgnj54efd 1781 the system press briefings the white house has all but stopped and sarah sanders the trump press mouthpiece the worse than having press briefings she provides real answers and generates more outrage questions and chaos than she had never held any press briefings interesting loves her exactly because this outrage that she creates

 also think lot about paladins and how play them and not sure paladins have serious noble knights least the oath the ancients offers possibility for happy paladin someone who overflowing with kindness and joy and from that has direct commitment opposing and defeating evil the author elizabeth moon made point her book the deed paksenarrion which literally her response the way players usually played paladins that can refute she said that the difference between paladin and soldier that paladin understands what disempowered wolves can trained defend sheep might even lot good but will never understand what feels like sheep and understanding that feeling that makes the paladin able effectively oppose evil the paladins you describe inspired mythical characters such sir kay king arthur qualify more wolves than sheep they nobility with lots war training and privileged position society really appreciate your breakdowns mostly just feel that the stock setting has paladins wrong that makes any sense

the article author does bring out some points which are pertinent although not for the same reason the author must have intended democracy what matters most win votes how one party candidate achieves that irrelevant ideally people must vote for candidate after researching his her views opinions background history etc ideally candidate must around informing people what she will elected what his her opinions are various issues ideally media should act behalf the people actively posing the candidate pertinent questions that people themselves would have liked ask him her media should analyse the candidate views opinions and actions educate and empower the people act wisely however are far from the ideal the one hand have people being swayed propaganda demagoguery and populism the other have media actively facilitating empowering and educating the politician out power instead the people such world politician can away with any non stipulatory practices where the dangers his her real face being revealed real instead she employs spin doctors press conferences town hall meets one one interviews one one interaction with people are ideal practices but people vote irrespective whether one practices them not politician wouldn want risk practicing like passing exam not mandatory the next class why take all rahul gandhi has started practice doing all this for this election because has very less baggage has relatively clean image wins this election and form govt seen whether will have the same alacrity when running for his second term

 you want stand stand you want sit sit but whatever you don wobble what you gotta make yourself happy don take the teachings seriously sometimes make mistakes and sometimes fuck for long time but with right intention most likely come back the practice would personally say that the adult webcam job probably contradicts buddhist practice but seems you enjoying there problem but perhaps you should spend some time alone asking yourself you really enjoy and want continue sometimes don realise that don actually want something until stop and think about thich naht hahn once said woman who had alcohol problems and couldn seem quit long enough gain any positive outcomes that she should stop trying quit for herself and quit for those around her who have problems with alcohol that mind set certainly helped give alcohol and drugs drink and drugs are great fun but unfortunately there are those out there who have serious problems with them and when drank took drugs the past felt was supporting those addicts not helping them but encouraging them stopped for them perhaps you could think the adult webcam job similar way what you doing helping others giving something positive the world linked world sexual misconduct abuse and harrassment

thanissaro bhikkhu ‚Äú all know what happens when fire goes out the flames die down and the fire gone for good when first learn that the name for the goal buddhist practice nibbana nirvana literally means the extinguishing fire hard imagine deadlier image for spiritual goal utter annihilation turns out though that this reading the concept mistake translation not much word image what did extinguished fire represent the indians the buddha day anything but annihilation according the ancient brahmans when fire was extinguished went into state latency rather than ceasing exist became dormant and that state ‚Äî unbound from any particular fuel ‚Äî became diffused throughout the cosmos when the buddha used the image explain nibbana the indian brahmans his day bypassed the question whether extinguished fire continues exist not and focused instead the impossibility defining fire that doesn burn thus his statement that the person who has gone totally out can described however when teaching his own disciples the buddha used nibbana more image freedom apparently all indians the time saw burning fire agitated dependent and trapped both clinging and being stuck its fuel burned ignite fire one had seize when fire let its fuel was freed released from its agitation dependence and entrapment ‚Äî calm and unconfined this why pali poetry repeatedly uses the image extinguished fire metaphor for freedom fact this metaphor part pattern fire imagery that involves two other related terms well upadana clinging also refers the sustenance fire takes from its fuel khandha means not only one the five heaps form feeling perception thought processes and consciousness that define all conditioned experience but also the trunk tree just fire goes out when stops clinging and taking sustenance from wood the mind freed when stops clinging the khandhas thus the image underlying nibbana one freedom the pali commentaries support this point tracing the word nibbana its verbal root which means unbinding what kind unbinding the texts describe two levels one the unbinding this lifetime symbolized fire that has gone out but whose embers are still warm this stands for the enlightened arahant who conscious sights and sounds sensitive pleasure and pain but freed from passion aversion and delusion the second level unbinding symbolized fire totally out that its embers have grown cold what the arahant experiences after this life all input from the senses cools away and she totally freed from even the subtlest stresses and limitations existence space and time the buddha insists that this level indescribable even terms existence nonexistence because words work only for things that have limits all really says about ‚Äî apart from images and metaphors ‚Äî that one can have foretastes the experience this lifetime and that the ultimate happiness something truly worth knowing the next time you watch fire going out see not case annihilation but lesson how freedom found letting ‚Äù html
