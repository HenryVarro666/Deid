CV:

-Echo 11/91:  bioprosthetic prosthetic valve in the mitral position. The valve appears well-seated.  The left atrium is dilated. There is restricted aortic leaflet opening c/w valvular aortic stenosis.  The peak trans AV gradient is 46 mmHg.  The mean trans AV gradient is 23 mmHg. The aortic valve area is 0.8 sqcm., calculated by the  continuity equation. (LVOT dimension=1.8 cm.)  (LVOT velocity=1.06 m/s.)  The peak velocity was obtained from the apical 5 chamber view.  There is evidence of mild aortic insufficiency.  The left ventricular cavity size is small.  The left  ventricular systolic function is within normal limits.  There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.  There are no obvious segmental wall motion abnormalities.  The estimated ejection fraction is 55 %.
