Reason for Visit

Sternal pain.



History of Present Illness

71 yo M with CAD, s/p CABG x 4 in 3/8[redacted]. He presents with pain over the lower part of his chest since Monday-- came on when he was in bed. The pain is located in [redacted], and is present all the time, worse with coughing, sneezing, or sudden deep breath. No change with exertion-- did his usual exercises (stretching, leg lifts, crunching) yesterday without a problem. No variation with food. No change with position (e.g., leaning forward). Denies productive cough, fever, chills, nausea, diaphoresis, palpitations. No radiation to the jaw or arm. The pain does not remind him of his sx prior to CABG (which he says was exertional SOB), but does feel like his incisional pain after the surgery (which eventually went away completely).

 

ROS as above, otherwise negative in detail. He says his pain is currently gone, and he feels fine lying back in the exam room.

Impression

Sternal pain-- non-exertional, reproducible by palpation, and not accompanied by ECG changes-- in pt who is s/p CABG seven months ago. Sx are different from his original anginal pain-- and I suspect he has some sort of focal inflammation / contusion over the lower part of the [redacted]. No sign, currently, of local or systemic infection. Doubt pneumonia (no cough or fever, lungs clear) or GI cause. Pericarditis a possibility (he had post-op pericarditis after his CABG), but no signs on ECG, and the pain is not positional.

 

Discussed the case with the pt's [redacted], [redacted]-- and we came up with the following plan:





Plan

- will send [redacted] is cardiac seems low

- check CXR

- send ESR, CBC/Diff

- OK for pt to go home after labs drawn and CXR done

- will contact Dr. Thorne's service (cardiac surgery) and Dr. Perez (PCP) to make them aware

- instructed pt to go to the ED immediately for increased pain, SOB, fever, or swelling/redness over the lower sternum
