He is feeling great.  He is all done with his radiation to the left axilla for metastatic
squamous cell cancer.  He is following closely with the radiation oncologist and the
medical oncologist.  He is seeing them both later this month.  He has had no
problems with chest pains or shortness of breath.  All in all, things are going well.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  On exam, no acute distress.  Lungs are clear.  Heart is regular
rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, gallops or rubs.  He does have some skin
discoloration around the left axilla but I feel no mass.  He has a well-healed incision. 
There is no hair noted in or around the axilla.  Extremities with no edema.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  

(1)  CAD/hypertension/diabetes mellitus.  This is stable.  Check glycosylated
     hemoglobin. 

(2)  Metastatic squamous cell cancer.  He is being followed closely by Oncology for
     this.  Follow-up with me in the spring.

Had some chest pains last weekend and he went to the ED.  The ED doctor noted that
his left axilla was tender and there was some pitting edema in the left side of
his neck.  The CT scan showed a 1.9 cm mass in the left axilla with no obvious
involvement of the left lung or mediastinum.  He has since improved and his chest
pain is gone.  He has an appointment with the medical oncologist in a few days.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  On exam, he still has tenderness in left axilla.  No
edema.  No obvious mass is palpable.  His lungs are clear and there is no
rhonchi.  The heart has a regular rate and rhythm and the jugular veins are equal
and soft.  He has some skin discoloration around the left axilla.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:

(1)  CAD/hypertension/diabetes mellitus.  This is stable.  Check glycosylated
     hemoglobin. 

(2)  Metastatic squamous cell cancer.  He is being followed closely by Oncology for
     this.  Follow-up with me in the spring.  Follow-up with the medical oncologist.
