Mr Gillespie is a 53 yo man with a history of NIDDM and hypertension who presented to House Of Calvary Hospital today with a chief complaint of cough for the last 5 days.  He was in his usual state of health prior to that.  Cough has been dry; also notes shortness of breath with exertion and diaphoresis.

He denies fever, chills, SOB at rest, orthopnea, PND, chest pain, wheezing, hemoptysis, and sick contacts.   He reports compliance with his medications and no recent change in diet.
