Answer: It is an error in the template.

\section{Why is it an error?}

The error is in the `\ifnumequal` statement, which is used to determine if `num_pages` is less equal to `num_columns` in the `\@startsection` macro. This is done so that `\@startsection` can determine if the section starts in the first or in the second column of the page. This is a very important decision, as the page layout in LaTeX is very important.

So `\ifnumequal` is used as the following:

\begin{code}
\ifnumequal{num_elements}{num_columns}
\end{code}

\strong{num_elements} is the total number of elements in a section and

\strong{num_columns} is the total number of columns in the page.

\strong{Example: Section 1:} This section has `num_elements=2` and `num_columns=4` elements.

So we have `num_elements=2` and `num_columns=4` elements and `\ifnumequal`.

So we get:

\begin{code}
\ifnumequal{2}{4}
\end{code}

\strong{Example: Section 2:} This section has `num_elements=1` and `num_columns=5` elements.

\strong{Example 2:} This section has `num_elements=1` and `num_columns=9` elements.

So in section 3, we have `num_elements=3` elements but the number of columns is `num_columns=2`. So `\ifnumequal` returns false and the section is not split.

\section{Problem}

The template you are using is using the following code:

\begin{code}
\renewcommand{\@startsection}[3]{%
%...
}%
\renewcommand{\@startsection}[3]{%
%...
}%
\renewcommand{\@startsection}[3]{%
%...
}%

\renewcommand\ifnumequal{\ifnumequal#2>#3}
\end{code}

As you can see, `\renewcommand` is not working well, as `>` is not the comparison operator between `num_elements` and `num_columns` (and also `>` is not a valid comparison operator with `num_elements` and `num_columns`).

The correct comparison operators to use are `>` or `>=`:

\begin{code}
\renewcommand\ifnumequal{\ifnumequal#2>#3>=#4}
\end{code}

\section{Solution}

The solution would be:

\begin{code}
\renewcommand\ifnumequal{\ifnumequal#2>#3\relax}
\end{code}
