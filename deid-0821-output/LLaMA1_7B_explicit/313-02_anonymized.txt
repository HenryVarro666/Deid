                                      PROMPTCAREIMA Clinic Note



Mrs. Rutledge is a former patient of Dr. Xia's who comes in today to establish a new PCP and for follow-up of her hypertension, diabetes, chronic renal insufficiency (baseline creatinine 2.2), and GERD.  She is currently on procardia xl, losartan, and atenolol for her hypertension.  She takes a baby aspirin qd for cardiac protection.  Her diabetes is controlled by diet alone, and her GERD by zantac 150 qd or bid prn.  Her last HbA1C was 6.9, with a malb/cr ratio of 222.2 and trace protein on U/A.  She has had a prior cardiac work-up for atypical chest pain with a negative ETT/SPECT in 2062 and a negative ETT in 2064.  An echo in 2062 showed an EF of 65% with no valvular abnormalities.



She is currently well with no complaints.  She is being followed in opthalmology for possible glaucoma.  She does not check her blood sugars at home, although she has a glucometer.  When asked if her sugars are ever low, she states that she has the same symptoms with hypoglycemia that she does with hyperglycemia: dizziness and hot flashes.  She's not had this recently.  She also does not check her BP at home.  She denies any numbness or tingling in her fingers, or any chest pain.  She did pull a muscle in her shoulder last night and still feels tender in that area.  She follows a diabetic diet (avoids sweets), gets no regular exercise, but works in Electrical and Avionics Mechanics so does have physical activity during the day.



PSHx: none

PGynHx: G7 P4 SAB1 TAB2, still menstruating q month, no hot flashes, heavy periods but no clots; LMP 10/01/66

Allergies: NKAD

Habits: never smoked, very rare EtOH, no illicit drugs



Medications:

ASA  81MG PO QD

ATENOLOL  100MG PO QD  (she has run out of this and did not take it today)

PROCARDIA XL  30MG PO QD

RANITIDINE HCL   150MG PO QD

LOSARTAN  50MG PO 2 qd

Assessment:  51 yo woman with diabetes, hypertension, CRI from hypertension/diabetic nephropathy likely. 



Current Plan:

1.  Diabetes.  Checking A1C off medication.  Would like to have patient check FS when she's feeling ill or if A1C is elevated.  Will refer to NP for review glucometer use, diabetic diet.  She has been tried on glucotrol XL in the past and was hypoglycemia.  This is also probably not a good choice due to her renal insufficiency.  May try glyburide if A1C elevated.  Being followed by opthalmology with upcoming appt.  Podiatry referral deferred.  Consider repeat referral to nutrition.  Lipids very good (LDL 82) last check off medication.

2.  Hypertension.  BP borderline elevated today, but off atenolol.  HR also up.  Refilled all meds; will ask NP to check her pressure at next visit.  Will continue qd ASA for CAD/stroke prevention.

3.  GERD.  Continue zantac bid as needed.  Also recommended that patient start using Tums for calcium supplementation and relief of intermittent dyspepsia.  She will try this and get back to me about the effect.

4.  Chronic renal insufficiency.  Will get 24-hour urine to assess creatinine clearance and urine protein.  Checking chem 7 today for K and Creatinine.

5.  Health maintenance.  Patient due to dT shot, requested today.  Normal mammogram in 5/66.  Stool guaiac and flex sig can be done at next appt; will follow-up Pap.

========================== Preceptor's Note ==========================



51 yr old with CRI, DN, GERD, and hypertension.  Creatinine was 2.2 last checked, and was controlled on losartan.  She was recently switched from a beta blocker to a Calc channel blocker due to the beta blockers causing hypoglycemia.  She was on 81mg aspirin qd, but was running out.  She does not have neuropathy.  She is active, but not exercising.  Her ETT and Echo are clear.  Her BMI is 28.6, which is overweight.



2.  Hypertension (B/P) 136/76, pulse is 76.



Plan:  1.	Refill all meds.  2.	Check A1C off med.  3.	Continue ASA for stroke prevention.  4.	Recommend glyburide if A1c is elevated.  5.	Consider NP for diabetic education and diet control and follow up of the glucometer.
