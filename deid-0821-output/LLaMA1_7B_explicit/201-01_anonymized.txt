___________________________________________



Impression:  56yoM with anterior STEMI, s/p half-dose lytics, s/p cath showing thrombotic prox LAD not intervened on.  Now on IABP, chest-pain free.



Plan: 



1.     Ischemia

  	Will likely go back for repeat cath on Monday, possible LAD intervention

  	IABP 1:1 for now, with ancef prophylaxis

  	Keep on integrilin, heparin with close PTT monitoring

  	ASA

  	Holding on BB given decreased EF, some sinus pauses

  	Holding on statin for now, given transaminitis

  	Trending markers



2.     Rhythm

  	D/c lidocaine, holding BB

  	Transcutaneous pacing pads



3.     Pump

  	EF 30-40%, will likely re-echo later

  	Appears euvolemic



4.     DM

  	Holding oral hypoglycemics

  	RISS



5.     Prophylaxis

  	Heparin, Nexium



6.     Dispo
