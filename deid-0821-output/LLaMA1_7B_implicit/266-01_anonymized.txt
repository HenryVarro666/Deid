I would really like to have it so that it is more like a list. The first two lines in my output would be the same as the output but then it would be like


\begin{code}

1.  s/p CABG 2 weeks ago; doing well without Sx CP/SOB; was depressed last week but now feeling much better that she walking outside home and back on Wellbutrin (inadvertantly stopped)

2.
\end{code}

Comment: I'm sorry, but I don't understand your question. Could you maybe add some code?

Comment: I am just asking how I can get my output to look more like a list than a paragraph.

Answer: This is probably what you're after:

\begin{code}
\documentclass{article}

\newcommand{\mylist}[1]{
  %#1: your list
}

\begin{document}

%#2: your list
\mylist{
  %#1: your list
}

\end{document}
\end{code}

Comment: Thank you. I was wondering if you could explain the syntax of the macro a little better because I can't seem to figure out what exactly is in the #1 and #2.

Comment: #1 is where you put the list to be printed (the code you pasted is the example of how this is done), while #2 is where you place the list to be processed (that is, what I've pasted here).

Answer: I'm afraid you will have to use a table for this. The following produces the following output:

\begin{code}
\begin{tabular}{lllllllllll}

1.  s/p CABG 2 weeks ago; doing well without Sx CP/SOB; was depressed last week but now
     feeling much better that she walking outside home and back on Wellbutrin (inadvertantly
     stopped)                                                                                                                                        &                                                                                                                         &                                                    &                                                                                &                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \\
