HPI: 

75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia and PAF with a prior stroke (2067) who subsequently was admitted to the OCH again for SDH with supratherapeutic INR in 2068. She has a prolonged hospital course as well as rehab stay and now returns having made significant recovery.  Her PEG was pulled-out in 06/69.  She is here with her husband who is translating from columbian.  



I saw her about 1 month a go with hiperpigmentation of the skin, which I felt was melasma, and treated her with hydroquinone TP, sun blocking cream and avoidance of sun exposure.  Both she and her husband say tha her hiperpigmentation has decreased significantly.   



At present she has no symptoms and says she feels well.  She ambulates with a cane, and she is planning a 6-month trip to Columbia next October with her husband.  



She denies any other symptoms: constipation, polydypsia, polyuria, excessive fatigue, weakness
