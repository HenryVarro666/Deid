Tanner, Yul

MR #099-04-65-0

I saw Mr. Tanner today for a routine follow-up visit.  I last

saw him in November of 2085.  In May he presented to the

emergency room with dehydration and hyperglycemia.  Diagnosis of

non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus was made.  He is now on

Glyburide and metformin.  His renal function at that time was

normal with a BUN of 15 and creatinine of 0.90.  His potassium at

that time was 4.6.  Otherwise, he is doing pretty well.  He has

lost about 40 lb.  He has seen a nutritionist regarding dietary

counseling.  

 

Today his weight is 258 lb.  Blood pressure 120/80.  Heart rate

100.  Current medications lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q.d.,

hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 q.d., Glyburide 5 mg p.o. q.d.,

metformin 500 mg t.i.d., diltiazem 180 p.o. q.d.   Urinalysis

shows 3+ blood, 4+ protein.

 

IMPRESSION:  #1)  Thin based membrane disease with persistent

hematuria and proteinuria.  #2)  History of renal ________.  

#3)  Type 2 diabetes.

 

PLAN:  Continue current medications.   Continue high water

intake.  Encourage weight loss and compliance with his diet.  

 

I spent some time talking to him about the importance of weight

loss and controlling his diabetes given his underlying kidney

disease.  Follow-up visit in nine months.

    Comments:  Patient is a 78 y.o. male with
                                    Type 2 DM 
                                    and thin

                                    disease.  He
                                    continues to
                                    show persistence of
                                    hematuria and
                                    proteinuria on urinalysis,
                                    despite being on ACE
                                    inhibitor,
                                    thiazide and diuretics.
                                    Weight is about 258 lbs.
                                    BUN is normal, but
                                    his creatinine is
                                    elevated at 1.03
                                    mg/dL.  I have
                                    discussed weight loss,
                                    diuretic use, diet
                                    control and the
                                    importance of
                                    keeping his
                                    blood pressure and
                                    urinary protein
                                    levels low
                                    in his continued
                                    follow-up.  Patient's
                                    potassium has been in
                                    the normal range on his
                                    previous visits, but
                                    was
                                    4.9 on his last urinalysis.
                    Medication:   Patient is currently taking
                                    Lisinopril, Hydrochlorothiazide,
                                    Glyburide, Metformin, Diltiazem,
                                    and
                                    Amlodipine 5 mg p.o. q.d. 
                                    for hypertension and
                                    hyperlipidemia.  I will be
                                    adjusting his
                                    medications to a
                                    maintenance dose at a
                                    lower daily
                                    dose of the
                                    Amlodipine 5 mg qd to
                                    lower his blood pressure 
                                    and I will be continuing
                                    the other medications.
                                    As he continues to have
                                    persistence of proteinuria
                                    and hematuria,
                                    I will be rechecking
                                    him in 9 months.
                                    If the proteinuria
                                    and hematuria persist,
                                    we will be looking for
                                    a kidney biopsy to
                                    evaluate for
                                    diabetic microvascular
                                    disease and/or renal
                                    amyloidosis.  I will
                                    be adjusting his
                                    diuretic
                                    therapy to
                                    reduce his urinary
                                    protein levels.
                                    I will be following
                                    him with his weight loss
                                    goals.  His weight
                                    loss of 25 lbs. should 
                                    bring his BMI down into a
                                    normal range.  His
                                    blood pressure is
                                    140/80 today.  I will
                                    continue his Lisinopril 40
                                    mg p.o. q.d., Hydrochlorothiazide
                                    12.5 mg q.d. and
                                    Metformin 500
                                    mg t.i.d. and we will
                                    continue to follow
                                    his potassium levels.  I
                                    have adjusted his
                                    Glyburide to Glyburide 2.5
                                    mg p.o. q.d. and
