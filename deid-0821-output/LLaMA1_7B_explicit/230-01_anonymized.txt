Comment: @Johannes_B, thanks! I've never seen `tabularx` package used this way and the documentation is pretty vague so I'm happy to take any feedback. (I've also updated the example to be compilable with `pdflatex` and `xelatex`.)

Comment: @Johannes_B, thanks. I have updated the code in my answer and the example to be compilable with `pdflatex` and `xelatex` so now it should run as it's written above.

Comment: I'm not able to reproduce the problem. The MWE above prints the text on a second row as expected.

Comment: @Johannes_B, Thanks for confirming this. I've updated the MWE above to include a version that can be reproduced in either `pdflatex` or `xelatex`. (The original MWE used `xetex` for the example to be compilable with that engine but I'm not able to reproduce the problem when using `pdflatex` or `xelatex`.)

Comment: Yes the MWE works with `pdflatex` and `xetex`.

Answer: Your example uses `tabularx`, but I'm not sure I understand what it's supposed to do. I've re-done the layout with a more simple approach using `array` and `tabular` environments.

In the MWE below I've set `\extrarowheight` to 4pt and used the `m` column type which makes the first character bold. You can use a smaller size if you wish.
