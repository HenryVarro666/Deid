EKG: NSR, prolonged QT-no change from prior-non specific ST/T wave abnormalities



CT Head-1.  No intracranial hemorrhage or CT evidence of acute stroke

	though MRI diffusion weighted imaging would be more sensitive.

	2. Stable encephalomalacia and Wallerian degeneration from left

	MCA stroke.

	3. Prior left pterional craniotomy and left MCA aneurysm 

      clipping.





Assessment/Plan:

1.	 Seizures-likely in setting of subtherapuetic Dilantin dose-will finish one gram load and start PO dilantin in am at 300 tid per neurology recommendations and check levels and await levels 10-15. Head CT negative for new process and no evidence of other reason for seizure. Patient on Keppra in past-needed now? Will ask neurology

2.	Pyuria-uncertian if significant due to the patient's likely minimal urine output-sent for culture-will await results-continue broad specrtrum coverage of potential pathogens with Vancomycin (1 gram given in ED) and ceftriaxone.

3.	High WBC-Abd CT reportedly negative as was CXR-will check final results and patient without symptoms-blood cultures pending-follow temp curve and WBC and continue abx until cultures negative

4.	Electrolyte abnormalities-patient on hemodialysis-will schedule for am-if not possible will have to treat for hyperkalemia.

5.	Renal transplant-continue Prednisone

6.	CVA-Will continue Aggrenox for now

7.	Other-continue home meds for now except lactobacillus as certain of purpose?
