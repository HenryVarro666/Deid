CC   slurred speech, L hand tingling



HPI

50 yo RHM  presents after episode of L hand tingling and slurred speech. He was in his usual state of health when he woke up at 8 am. At around 10 am he told his son that he was not feeling well and went to bed. He reports that his speech was normal at that time. At 11:30 his wife called him and his speech was slurred. He was able to say real words but they were slurred and almost unintelligible. He also had L hand tingling. The slurred speech and tingling resolved at 12:15 pm. He denies weakness, diplopia, difficulty swallowing, headache, vertigo, chest pain, palpitations.



One week ago, while he was on vacation in Chincoteague, he had a transient episode of slurred speech. He reports that as he was walking to the bathroom, he suddenly felt lightheaded and fell. He had slurred speech and difficulty standing up but no focal weakness. The episode lasted minutes.
