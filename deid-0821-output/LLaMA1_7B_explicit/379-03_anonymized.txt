NANCY-JASMINE,NIKKOLAS   693-31-18-1                VISIT DATE: 04/28/93

The patient was seen, interviewed and examined by myself as well as 

Dr. Judd whose note I have reviewed, and whose findings I have 

confirmed. 

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This patient is a 68 year-old 

male who presents with slurred speech.  The patient has a history 

of a prior cerebrovascular accident with residual right sided 

deficit.  One day prior to arrival, the patient was found to have 

increasing slurring of speech and he was found to increasing 

weakness over his baseline on the right side.  The patient arrives 

without acute complaints except for difficulty speaking.  He denies 

any headache.  He also does complain of some throat pain. 

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Review of systems is as per the written note.  

The patient denies fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath 

or dysphagia.  

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient's past medical history is 

significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular 

accident and otherwise as per the written note.

MEDICATIONS:  The patient's medications include Tylenol, aspirin, 

Avenida, Glucophage, Zoloft, hydrochlorothiazide, metoprolol and 

otherwise as per the written note.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies. 

SOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's social history 

and family history are as per the written note and are significant 

for past tobacco use and no alcohol use.  He lives with family and 

goes to a day care facility.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  The patient is a well nourished 

male in no acute distress.  VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 97, pulse 62, 

respiratory rate 16, blood pressure 163/96, oxygen saturation 100% 

on room air.  NECK:  Supple with full range of motion.  No nuchal 

rigidity.  LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally with good air 

movement.  CARDIAC:  Regular with ectopy.  No murmur is 

auscultated.  NEUROLOGIC:  Alert, oriented x 3, dysarthric.  Finger 

to nose is within normal limits bilaterally.  There is 5/5 motor 

strength throughout the left upper extremity and left lower 

extremity.  The right upper extremity and right lower extremity 

there is 3/5 motor strength throughout all motor groups tested.  

The patient is able to follow all commands.  His ability to 

understand appears to be completely intact.  

Further details of the patient's physical examination are as per 

the written note.

LABORATORY EVALUATION:  Laboratory studies are significant for a 

glucose of 195, BUN of 14, creatinine of 1.2, bicarbonate of 26, CK 

of 68, toxicology screen which is negative, troponin of 0.04, white 

count of 7.4, hematocrit of 42.0, platelets of 327 and a urinalysis 

that is pending.  A head CT is also pending.

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient was interviewed and 

examined in the emergency department.  His past medical records 

were reviewed.  The patient has new neurologic findings on top of 

an old cerebrovascular accident.   

CONSULTATIONS (including PCP):  The neurology service was therefore 

consulted and a head CT was ordered.  The patient will be admitted 

to the neurology service for further work up and he will likely 

also undergo an MRI/MRA.

admitted to the neurology service in satisfactory condition.
