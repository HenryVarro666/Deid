      Reason for visit:
    Mrs Vanmeter presents for routine follow up of her CAD, HTN and hyperlipidemia




      Interval History:
    She presents stating that she is getting along reasonably well. Her main problem is burning in her legs and feet, also present in her hands. She also reports an increased frequency of her chest tightness, occuring mainly at night, sometimes before going to sleep, sometimes durign the night. This is responsive to 1 SL TNG typically, although sometimes is goes away without intervention. She denies SOB, PND, orthopnea, presycope or syncope. She has intermittant mild LE edema. She occasionally has palpitations, lasting ~ 5 minutes, resolving spontaneously. She cannot relate them to any time of day or activity, and they are not associated w/ lightheadedness or CP.


Recently she called me w/ complaints of increased LE edema. This is minor on exam. Her echo showed preserved LV function and no significnat valvular disease.

      Assessment and plan:
    Mrs. Vanmeter presents today stating that she continues to have some mild nighttime chest discomfort, responsive to SL TNG. Her last stress test was in January 2082 and was without ischemia with a posterobasal scar (Adeno MIBI). A recent echo in June 2081 done to evaluate increased LE edema was normal.


Problems:
      


Coronary artery disease  -  She reports an increased frequency of her nighttime CP and takes SL TNG when with good relief. Takes it about once/month. These episodes only occur at night when she is in bed.  Her echo showed preserved LV function and no significnat valvular disease.  A repeat adenosine MIBI was negative for recurrent ischemia with an inferobasal scar and LVEF 54%. I advised her to take an H2 blocker before bedtime and if symptoms don't improve, seek a workup with her PCP.


      


Hyperlipidemia  -  Her last lipid profile showed that her LDL was in range at 67, and her TG were normal! I advised her about the metabolic syndrome and the importance of careful diabetic control as well as regular exercise.  Continue her present dose of statin.


      


HTN  -  Her BP is well-controlled today. Continue her current regimen.
