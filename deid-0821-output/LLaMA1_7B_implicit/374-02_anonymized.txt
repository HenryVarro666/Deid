Personal data and overall health   This is a 54-year-old woman with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, glucose intolerance, depression, and agoraphobia.



Reason for visit   Extended interval visit.



Major Problems

Depression

/chronic mood disorder with elements of paranoia/(?) psychosis/agoraphobia.  Medicines reviewed.  She will follow up with Dr. Thurston.  She is largely homebound, fearful of her phone, fearful of going out, overeating, under exercising but not despondent or self-destructive.  She does have support from sister and brother who live at home with her. 

P:  Per Dr. Thurston.  Discussed the potential of transitional therapist if she relocates.

Family history risk factors

/ cad;diabetes.  An episode of chest discomfort occurred at rest watching TV.  He had to get up and go to bed.  They were no episymptoms of sweat, nausea, vomiting, and dyspnea, but she did have both chest and left arm discomfort, the duration was an hour, this occurred a month ago.  She has been active since then around the house without pain and had no pain walking in today.  

A:  Episode of chest discomfort with family history of CAD and multiple risk factors. 

P:  Check EKG.  She will call for recurrent symptoms.

Glucose intolerance

/family history of diabetes.  Lots of sugars and carbohydrates.  Weight is up. 

P:  Update hemoglobin A1c next month when she returns for fasting blood; urine microalbumin today; long overdue for an eye exam and she and her sister promised to schedule this.  Diet reviewed and weight program urged.

Hiatal hernia

Only occasional reflux and heartburn but one episode at the holiday rather vigorous reflux with a vomiting episode without chest pain.  There was vigorous vomiting and she actually experienced some blood.  She states "one-half cup."  Stools were dark for several days thereafter, then cleared, now normal and she has had no satiety, dysphagia, or recurrent symptoms.  She has a well documented GERD and reflux, and HH on barium swallow in 2123.  She has not been having major breakthrough reflux on Prilosec 20 mg.  

A:  Episode of reflux, vomiting possible esophageal tear with symptoms now abated and color looks good.  She does not appear markedly anemic.  There are no symptoms to suggest Barrett, but obviously this is a consideration. 

P:  Check CBC, stool guaiac for starters and iron level.  If she significantly anemic and these symptoms persist an EGD would be appropriate though he may have to negotiate this, given her agoraphobia.  Minimally, she will stay on Prilosec one or two a day in the meantime and call me if there is anymore vomiting, bleeding, or black stools.

Hypertension

Blood pressure is okay.P:  Continue current treatment.     02/16/2130:

Menstrual disorder

/ status post hysterectomy, BSO for endometriomas, fibroids.  Ran out of Premarin three days ago, not terribly troubled by hot flashes. 

P:  Discontinue Premarin.  If hot flashes reoccur badly, we can go to 0.3 and then wean more slowly.  She will let me know.

Overweight

P:  Encouraged weight loss.     02/16/2130:

Sciatica

No recurrence.     02/16/2130:

Seizure disorder

We will check Tegretol level, CBC, and LFTs.  She is overdue and had episode at the holidays of fainting like feeling without seizure prodrome or seizure activity. 

P:  Check levels.  Call for any further episodes.  Described episode was not clearly arrhythmic by her symptoms and she had no post ictal.  She will let me know if this occurs again and seek attention at that time.

Sleep apnea

Sister states she needs a new sleep device and we will take care of a referral on contact from her supplier.

Gallstones

/ status post cholecystectomy at time of hysterectomy.  The episode of abdominal discomfort and vomiting was not clearly colic and she is post hysterectomy, but might have a recurrent stone.  No obvious icterus today.
