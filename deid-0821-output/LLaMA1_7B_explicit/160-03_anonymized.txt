ID/CC: 59 RHF decreasing visual acuity





HPI: Ms Uher was doing well until 8/70 when she she was noted to have several "staring spells." At the same time she had increased gait instability leading to admission to SLMC. A head MRI was reportedly normal. She improved and was discharged without treatment or diagnosis. At that time she also noticed subtle decline in visual acuity and eye exam confirmed this. She was told that this was caused by her diabetes. Her vision continued to worsen and she was treated with laser OS. Over the past month her balance has worsened nad her vision has continued to deteriorate. She reports severe HA in 8/70 but none recently. She was seen by ophtalmology at SGAH and noted to have optic disc swelling, cotton wool spots and hemorrhages. She was sent to CCH EW for evaluation.





ROS:She c/o painful dysesthesia and weakness BLE (lonstanding). She denies HA, tinnitus, vertigo, numbness, fever, chills, cough, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, heartburn, constipation, diarrhea, dysuria, incontinence, or rash.
