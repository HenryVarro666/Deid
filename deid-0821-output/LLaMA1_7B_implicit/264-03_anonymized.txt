EDVISIT^24152563^Pierre, Eden^07/15/90^MCCARTY, QUINTON

Seen with Dr. Feliciano.  The past medical history, social

history, family history, review of systems, medications, and

allergies were reviewed and confirmed.  Please see resident's

note for further details.  I had interviewed and examined the

patient myself.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Briefly, this is a 75-year-old

female with a known history of CAD, status post MI, EF of 10 to

15% with an AICD placement.  Also, history of CHF and

hyperparathyroidism.  She presents with complaints of shortness

of breath for the past 3 hours with some epigastric discomfort. 

She denies fever, chills, or cough.  She has had some abdominal

and chest discomfort.  She may be from 1 year ago showing no

reversible ischemia but a previous catheterization showing no

disease.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives with her family.  She is a former

smoker.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Otherwise, negative.

MEDICATIONS:  She takes albuterol, Lipitor, captopril, digoxin,

Levoxyl, Lasix, and Coumadin.

ALLERGIES:  Has allergies to morphine.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is afebrile, heart rate111, blood

pressure 105/7118, and oxygen saturation 100% on 4 liters.  She

is awake, alert, and in moderate distress.  HEENT: 

Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils:  Equal, round and reactive to

light.  Sclerae are anicteric.  Neck is supple and nontender. 

Chest is with bibasilar crackles.  Cardiovascular exam: 

Irregularly irregular with a 2/6 systolic murmur at the left

upper sternal border.  Abdomen is soft and nontender.  Skin is

warm and dry.  Extremities without clubbing, cyanosis, or edema. 

Neurological:  Alert and oriented.  Cranial nerves II through XII

are intact.  There are no motor or sensory deficits.

Initial cardiogram showing numerous PVCs with occasional negative

complex is consistent with her previous EKG with the appearance

of likely atrial fibrillation.  After some diuresis and a beta

blockade, she has slowed down to the 90s from the 130s and

appeared to have normal sinus rhythm with frequent PVCs.  Her

chest film shows some mild CHF, and she was started on heparin.

LABORATORY DATA:  Sodium 134, glucose 178.  Normal extending

chemistries.  CK of 115 with an MB of 2.  Digoxin level is 0.8. 

TSH is 8.8.  Troponin is less than assay.  White count is 7.5,

hematocrit 42, and platelets 238,000.  INR 2.1.  Heparin was not

initiated as she was already anticoagulated, but she did receive

diuresis.  She is admitted in stable condition.

CLINICAL IMPRESSION:  Unstable angina with frequent PVCs.  Her

cardiology consultation is pending at this time.
