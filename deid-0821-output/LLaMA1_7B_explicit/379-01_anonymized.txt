Nikkolas Nancy-Jasmine

693-31-18-1



I saw Nikkolas Nancy-Jasmine today for evaluation concerning his stroke in August 2091.  The information available today is limited to his knowledge of the events.



He is an 67-year-old Honduran man with a history of diabetes mellitus and HTN.  In August he suffered a stroke.  He reports that his speech was affected and that he developed severe right arm and leg weakness without sensory loss.  He recalls no problem with his vision.  He was hospitalized at Dubuque Obstetrics Gynocology Center.  He does no know the extent of the evaluation.  He was discharged on aspirin to Mitchell County Hospital.  He is now living at home with his wife and son with visiting nurse assistance.  His primary care physician is at Flagler Hospital.  He has severe residual weakness of the right arm and leg.  He also complains of dizziness and an abnormal numbness in his mouth.  The dizziness is worst in the morning.  He also notices a noise in his head when he sleeps.



He has DM and HTN.  He is a nonsmoker.  I don't have cholesterol information.  There is no history of cardiac disease.  There is no history of alcohol abuse.



He is currently taking aspirin, insulin, antihypertensive medication of some type and possibly a cholesterol lowering agent, although he is no sure of this.  He has no known allergies.



He is aware of no significant family history.



He is married.  He lives with his wife and 22-year-old son.  He came to america from Honduras in 2073.  He worked nights in construction until his stroke.



Pulse 66, regular.  BP 186/110.  There are no cranial bruits.  The carotid pulses are full with no bruits.  The lungs are clear.  The heart is regular with no murmur.  The abdomen is benign.  The mental state is normal; he speaks Spanish and broken English.  He is able to name, repeat, and comprehend well.  His fluency in his native language is probably normal.  Cranial nerves are intact.  There is severe weakness of the right arm and leg: right interossei and finger flexors 1/5, finger extensors 0/5, biceps 1/5, triceps 0-1/5, deltoid 0-1/5.  (He tries to raise his arm proximally by elevating the shoulder.)  Right iliopsoas 2/5, quadriceps 2/5, hamstrings 1/5, distally 0/5.  The tone is only mildly increased.  Sensation is intact.  Reflexes are slghtly brisker in the right upper extremity (RUE 2+/4, LUE 2/4, knees 2+/4, ankles 2/4).  The right plantar response is mute; he withdraws the left.  Coordination is intact; weakness inhibits adequate testing on the right.  He wears a right AFO.  He can stand up from his wheelchair and bear weight maneuvering himself to the examining table, but he cannot walk unsupported.



His examination is most consistent with a right equal arm and leg pure motor hemiparesis, sparing the face.  This was likely due to a lacunar infarction in the left basis pontis from small vessel occlusion.  He has major stroke risk factors, including DM, HTN, and probably hypercholesterolemia.  Currently his major needs are to establish good control of his blood pressure and to control other risk factors, including optimtal glucose control and likely medication for hyperlipidemia, and to continue physical and occupational therapy to maximize his functional status.



To review the studies that were done to investigate his stroke in August, I will request the record of that hospitalization from DOGC.  I will also request his records from his physician at the Flagler Hospital.  He will certainly need an adjustment of his antihypertensive regimen.  He tells me that he is planning to see his PCP for this purpose.  I asked him to return here in a month to review this.





Sincerely,







Patrick Winn, M.D.

\section{Appendix 3: Annotated Record of an Interview for the \textsc{Stroke} Dataset}

This interview contains a set of questions to a patient about a stroke that they experienced and a second set of questions to their primary care provider about the diagnosis.  These questions are used to generate a record of a stroke that the provider has seen, along with a summary of the care provided for the patient.  This interview, and the other three, can be seen as a way to generate the record of a \textsc{Stroke} record, which is the input for the downstream tasks in this paper.  The questions in this interview were adapted from a previous interview by \cite{Koenig2004}.  This was a paper that evaluated the usefulness of a similar interview in a clinical environment.  We have included the original interview questions in Appendix 3, along with the original responses, so that the reader can compare our work to theirs, which can be seen at: \url{ftp://ftp.csl.sri.com/pub/projects/medical-records/2004_Stroke_interview.pdf}.  We have included our annotations to the patient's response on the left.  The original interview was given to patients who were not yet seen by a physician for their stroke.  This paper is intended for patients that have already been seen by a physician, and the interviews have been adjusted for this.  This interview is also intended to be given in person.



\subsection{Interview for Patient}

The first part of the questionnaire is for patients to fill out information about their stroke.  This part of the interview is designed to get information about: their symptoms before, during and after their stroke, their stroke location, their stroke risk factors, and the care they received after their stroke.  We have included a summary of the questions asked and the answers given by the patient, in the interview below.  After asking about the patient's general medical history, we ask the following questions regarding the patient's stroke:

\subsubsection{Question 1: Before stroke}

\begin{tcolorbox}
\textbf{Question}:\textup{How was your stroke?}
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=white,colframe=black]
\textbf{Response:}  I had a sudden weakness in my right arm and leg.
\end{tcolorbox}

The patient's response is summarized above as a short answer.  This answer is used as part of our model to determine which types of stroke the patient had (see section 4.1 for more information).  In this dataset this question is used to determine whether the patient suffered a hemiparesis or aphasia, which is used as part of the classification in this section.

\subsubsection{Question 2: During stroke}

\begin{tcolorbox}
\textbf{Question}:\textup{How did it feel during the stroke?}
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=white,colframe=black]
\textbf{Response:}  My arm and leg were numb and weak.  I could not speak or move my arm or leg.  I was not able to walk, and I could not hold things.
\end{tcolorbox}

We have included the full transcript of the question and the response to this question, to illustrate how the questions were asked and how the patient answered.  This response is also used to determine whether the patient suffered aphasia or a hemiparesis, which is used in the classification in this section.

\subsubsection{Question 3: After stroke}

\begin{tcolorbox}

\textbf{Question}:\textup{Where and when were you admitted?}:

In this section the interview also asked about the patients admission time and date of hospital admission. \textbf{What was your diagnosis of the stroke?}:
