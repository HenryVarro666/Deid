HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 51-year-old woman who comes to SDCC to initiate longitudinal care and for follow up of medical problems.


PROBLEMS:  Hypertension.  She has a long history of hypertension.  She has not seen a doctor in a year.  She is currently taking:
1.  Amlodipine 10 mg p.o. daily.
2.  Lisinopril 20 mg daily.
3.  Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. daily.


MEDICATIONS:  As noted above.


ALLERGIES:  No known allergies to any medications.


SOCIAL HISTORY:  She moved here one year ago from Big Pine Key.  Has not had medical care here.


REVIEW OF SYMPTOMS:  Notable for chest pain, episodic left-sided anterior, for many months. No significant weight change, febrile signs or symptoms, headache, blurred vision, tinnitus, cough, shortness of breath, nausea, abdominal pain, nightsweats, diarrhea, dysuria, polyuria, skin rash, bruising, joint pain, or focal weakness.  


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is in no acute distress.  Blood pressure by nurse 160/90, by me 150/100, weight 222 pounds, height 63.5 inches, BMI 38.8.  Skin exam:  No rash.  Head and neck:  Normal.  Chest:  Clear to percussion and auscultation.  There is focal tenderness over two left-sided mid costochondral junctions which reproduced chief complaint.  Cardiovascular exam:  No extra sounds or murmurs.  Abdominal exam:  No masses, tenderness, or organomegaly.  Musculoskeletal exam:  Full range or motion without tenderness all joints in both upper extremities and lower extremities, no pedal edema.


ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1.  Hypertension.  Currently, she is not in good control despite three medications.  She reports taking medications today, but about an hour ago.  Will make no changes today, but follow up in one week.  She uses alot of salt which I adviced her not to do
2.  Costochondritis.  No intervention necessary.
3.  Obesity.  This will be the subject of future discussions.
4.  Adult health maintenance.  The patient will return for fasting lipids and other blood work.  I will see her in one week for a comprehensive exam.

Comment: This answer is very useful. I'm going to use your code as a starting point, and try to find a solution.

Comment: This is very helpful.

Comment: @JosieGarcia I've edited my answer so that it is now more generic (I hope). It uses the `floatrow` package, which is very powerful.

Answer: As I've said in my comment, I'm going to make the best use of this answer as a starting point. Here is what I've come up with so far (I am still learning TeX, so my code may be somewhat clumsy):

\begin{code}
\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{floatrow}

\begin{document}\footnote{Code from answer of [Josie Garcia](https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/267533/64694):}
\begin{floatrow}
  \ffloatsep=2pt
  \caption{My caption} \label{label1000}\label{label100}
\end{floatrow}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{example-image-a}
\centering
\caption{My caption}
\label{label1000}\label{label100}
\end{figure}
\end{tabular}
\end{document}
\end{code}

The only things I changed are: (1) the removal of the `\label` (the figure will already have a label, which is what I need here), and (2) the removal of the `\end{tabular}` (the figure already ends at the right place, so there is no need for it.

Here is the result in the pdf viewer:

Answer: You can make it easier for yourself using the `floatrow` package, which is part of the `float` family of packages.

\begin{code}
\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{floatrow}

\begin{document}\footnote{Code from answer of [Josie Garcia](https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/267533/64694):}
\begin{floatrow}
  \ffloatsep=2pt
  \caption{My caption} \label{label1000}\label{label100}
  \floatsetup[figure]{width=\textwidth}
  \centering
      \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{example-image-a}
\end{floatrow}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\begin{figure}[h]
\caption{My caption}
\label{label1000}\label{label100}
\end{figure}
\end{tabular}
\end{document}
\end{code}

This way you don't need to add the labels manually: `\label{labelname}` and you can make your figure the same size (in my example) by using the optional argument of `figure` to tell LaTeX the width you want.
