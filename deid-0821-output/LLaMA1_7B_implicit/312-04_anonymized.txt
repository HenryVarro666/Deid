Team 2 Internal Medicine Intern Admission Note



Name:  Ethridge, Clayton

MR#:  8381729

Admit Date: 7/28/64

Attending:  Dr. Tomlin

Admitting intern: Ursula Quiles, MD

Code: Full



Source: Medical record, Patient



Chief Complaint: fistula clot



History of Present Illness:  Pt is a 59 yo Khazakhstani male, with h/o HTN, DM, mucormycosis, and ESRD on HD presenting with a thrombosed AVF in his left arm, established in April of 2064 by Dr. Jordon.  The patient has a history of multiple problems with access (clots, stenoses), requiring frequent thrombectomies and revisions.   The patient first noticed a problem on July 23, and by the 24th he said that "the access had collapsed." On July 25, interventional radiology attempted to thrombectomize the clot, with no success, requiring placement of a new tunneled catheter in left IJ to allow dialysis.  At present, patient is on the OR waiting list for tomorrow, for thrombectomy/revision.  



Of note, patient was admitted in April of 2064 after a nurse at the McLaren Hospital detected a new cardiac murmur.  Pt was found to have a RA thrombus by echo, presumed to be a complication from a prior catheter, started on a heparin gtt and transitioned to coumadin.  



ROS: No fever/chills, HA, SOB, CP, N/V/D (though states that stomach sometimes "sensitive").
