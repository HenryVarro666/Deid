MSH Adult Medicine Office Visit                              PCP Dr Whitehead



73 yr old woman with HTN, SP CABG, fibromyalgia comes in for follow up of renal MRA done for evaluation of renal insufficiency and associated high K.

She was hospitalized in 7/97 for a fairly acute deterioration of renal function and hyperkalemia.  At that time she was told to DC Lisinopril and Vioxx.  Her renal function seemed to improve with that intervention though in early August her K+ rose a bit.  The VNA has been seeing her at home.  According to the patient her BP has been "normal".

She and her daughter come in now to review results of the recent renal MRA.  They are seeing me because there  were no appts available for her with her PCP.  

She denies any chest pain, shortness of breath.  Appetite is good.

She has been trying to avoid foods high in potassium but she is not sure about K+ content of many foods.

She has been taking Lisinopril at the same dose since her CBG in 2095 and has been taking NSAIDs for fibromyalgia for several years.
