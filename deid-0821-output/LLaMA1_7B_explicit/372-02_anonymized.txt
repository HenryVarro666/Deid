Past medical history   Paraplegia- On 10/06 the patient had a lumbar laminectomy for sciatica. His sciatical pain improved until 5/07 when he developed proximal leg weakness. By 7/07 the patient was bound to a wheelchair. Orginally an extensive workup suggested that the patient had an extramedullary tumor from T8-T12. However all biopsies were inconclusive. The patient subsequently received a T10 laminectomy on 9/09 that revealed Spinal Vascular Malformation but no tumor. The patient received serial MRI's until 12/14 that were able to demonstrate no "recurrent" tumors.
