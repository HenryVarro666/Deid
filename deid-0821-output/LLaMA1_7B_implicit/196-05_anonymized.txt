\subsection{Data Annotation}

The first and foremost task we performed was annotating the medical record with its constituent elements. For example, an event is denoted by an occurrence of the word ``\textit{hospitalization}'' in the record. We used a combination of manual and semi-automatic techniques to label various aspects of the medical records in the dataset.

The manual techniques involved two levels: the first step involves marking a sentence as containing the medical record elements or not; this involves looking at the syntactic structure of the sentence (e.g. whether it is the subject of the sentence), its location in the document (e.g. whether it is in the first paragraph of the document) and semantic information about the sentence (e.g. whether it is about a patient's condition or not). We performed this task manually by having 100 annotators label each sentence. We then used a set of heuristics to reduce the number of disagreements between the annotators. For example, an event is denoted as being a diagnosis if it is preceded by either the words: `diagnosis' or 'diagnosed with'. The second level of manual labeling involves looking at a sentence that has been marked by one of the above-mentioned criteria and labeling it further according to its sub-structure. For example, a sentence that is a diagnosis will also be a medical event or an observation. This task was again performed by 100 annotators. The final set of labels for each sentence includes a primary label and a set of secondary labels (if any).

We developed semi-automatic techniques for the labeling process. These techniques are based on a machine learning classifier that is trained using manually annotated medical records. We then apply this classifier to the rest of the medical records in the dataset and use the results to label the remaining medical records. This process can be repeated several times, each time using a more complex classifier to label the remaining medical records. In our case, we have applied this technique to label the remaining medical records three times. Table \ref{tab:annotation} shows the final result of the manual and semi-automatic methods for labeling the medical records. Note that the manual and semi-automatic methods are complementary and that both methods have to be used for a thorough annotation of medical records.
