? SCCA of nose.  Derm referral.

L carotid bruit.  Given known cerebrovascular disease needs NICS 

Cardiac.  Obtain old records from cardiologist.  Recent ECHO and stress evals.

Voiding dysfunction.  Check psa.  Likely BPH but could relate in part to cognitive issues.  Begin alpha blocker as he needs better BP control as well.
