\subsection{Recommendation to the patient}

\subsubsection{Hypertension}

Hypertension is a common condition and it should be treated as soon
as it is diagnosed. The patient has been started on a regimen of Lisinopril.

\subsubsection{Diabetes mellitus}

The patient has been seen by a dietitian who has counseled her on diet and exercise and has initiated treatment with Metformin.

\subsubsection{Obesity}

The patient has gained weight and has been referred to the Center for Weight Management.

\section*{Conclusion}

Hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and obesity are all common medical problems,
often comorbid, and are likely to increase as a consequence of the aging of the population. It is important to diagnose and treat these problems in patients with diabetes mellitus as this will lead to improved glycemic control and a longer disease-free state.
