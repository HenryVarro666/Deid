\chapter{Introduction}

The purpose of this chapter is to present the general idea of the

project: the development and use of an automatic system for the

generation of thumbnails and their storage in a database.

This system can be used not only for the creation of thumbnails, but also

for the generation and storage of the original images. In this system,

it is necessary to store the name of the image and of course, the path to

this image file, to create the thumbnail with the name of the

thumbnail image and the number of the thumbnail and also, to store this image.

It is possible to use a thumbnail of the image and to create the thumbnail


of thumbnail, also, the number of the thumbnail, of a thumbnail.
