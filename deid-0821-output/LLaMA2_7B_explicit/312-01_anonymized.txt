Record date: 2062-10-30

54 yo male from Kazakhstan here for f/u of GI mucor.  Briefly, he was admitted 6/20/62 with DKA and MSSA bacteremia.  He was found to have perirectal abscess s/p CT-guided drains as well as L hip infected prosthesis and abscess s/p removal and drainage in OR on 7/07 and by IR 7/22, both sites positive for MSSA.  Hospital course c/b GIB and was found to have free air with perforated duodenum s/p ex-lap 6/22, gastrectomy with partial large bowel resection, splenectomy and primary anastamosis, with path positive for mucormycosis without clean margins.  He also had VRE/klebsiella LUQ abscess s/p IR drainage.  

He was initially treated with nafcillin and ambisome, but developed maculopapular rash on chest and arms thought to be secondary to nafcillin.  So he was switched to vanco/ambisome/linezolid/meropenem/amikacin for LUQ abscess.  After 6 weeks of high-dose ambisome, he was taken back to OR on 7/31 for re-exploration and was found to have some more necrosis around his esophageal-jejunostomy site that surgeons "scooped out" as much as they could, but were not able to get clean margins because of difficult anatomic restrictions. 
Given the inability to completely en-bloc resect Mr. Ethridge's GI mucor despite a long-trial of Ambisome, he was started on an investigational drug, posaconazole, provided by Emcor on a compassionate use basis.  This has had 50% success of curing mucor as salvage therapy in small trials.  He was started on this drug on 8/28/62 and has tolerated it well despite some nausea, diarrhea.  

He has been at EDUCARE-FARGO reports increase in strength and improved ability to bear weight on his hip.  He walks with a walker.  He had repeat CT abd/pelvix 10/26 which showed no intraabdominal collection and stable L hip collection.  He had abd drains removed 3 weeks ago but continues to have L hip drain, without much output.  He was started on TPN 1 week ago due to maltrition, despite po intake.  He has been trying to eat, but reports some nausea and diarrhea, especially after he eats and since starting posaconazole.  He reports good glycemic control.  He denies fevers/abd pain/nightsweats/chills/visual changes/HA/melena/cough/SOB.

Imp:

54 yo male with DM s/p long hospital course for DKA, multiple infections in hip and abd, and GI mucor s/p resection x2, but with residual disease.  Currently on posaconazole and tolerating well, but does have significant nausea, somewhat controlled with zofran.  Diarrhea can be a component posaconazole side effect, or due to dumping syndrome.



Plan:

1) continue posaconazole

2) need to have ortho f/u to evaluate L hip collection

3) RTC in 1 month 12/04/62 at 10am to f/u for posaconazole.  Will need EKG again at EDUCARE-FARGO before transfer here.



Mr. Ethridge seen and examined with Dr. Roberts.  He is very slowly improving in terms of strength, no doubt in part due to nocturnal TPN.  Hard to tease out the cause of his nausea, although anatomic reasons are as likely as medication side effects.  On balance, if his labs are ok, I'd favor continuing the posaconazole given most recent OR findings.  ECG without QTc prolongation.  Abdomen is bening.  Left hip still sore, but more and more stable.

Answer: You will have to do the following, to get what you want from the XML file.

1) Convert the XML file to a CSV file using the XSLT stylesheet below and an XSL-FO processor. In the XSL-FO processor, set the `output` property to `file`, the `format` property to `csv`, and the `encoding` to `UTF-8`.  In the XSL-FO processor, you can either create a new file or append to an existing one.

\begin{code}

Comment: This works perfectly.  Thank you @Martin!  I'm going to have to spend some time figuring out the logic behind this.  But thank you so much!

Comment: @user2708115, I'm not familiar enough with DocBook to give an opinion on the stylesheet above. If you want, you could try to create an XSLT stylesheet to convert the XML to CSV, then use a Java program or script to read that file as a CSV and print a CSV to a console or file.

Comment: I was actually going to try it with Java as I'm not familiar with XSLT at all.  I have a Java program that does something very similar.  I will give your XSLT style sheet a try.  Thank you!

Comment: @user2708115, I've just tried converting the DocBook file to a CSV file and then reading it as a CSV with a Java program and it works.  You can take a look at the [source code](http://www.xmlblueprints.com/java/201308021755-1.zip).  The program does the following: 1) Reads the file `src/main/resources/data/patient-notes.xml` as a DocBook document. 2) Uses the stylesheet from my answer to convert it to a CSV file. 3) Reads the file `patient.csv` and prints the contents of the file to the console.  If you need any help converting a DocBook file to another format, let me know.
