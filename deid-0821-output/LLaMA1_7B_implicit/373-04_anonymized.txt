Record date: 2087-02-20


78 yo gentleman


Known to Dr William Dodd


Transferred from Duchesne County Hospital 2/19


Chief complaint: Recurrent pleural effusion


HPI: Daughter present. She gives a h/o father being unwell since last admission in 11/86 for PNA and pleural effusion. Got progressively more SOB and more confused. Previously independent, was becoming more dependent for ADLs. 
Summary of OSH course as per Team 1 admit note. I spoke with Hospitalist, Dr Bates about patient on 2/18. Seen by Thoracic Surgery at OSH and recommended for de-cortication. In light of complex medical history, including Coumadin use, it was recommended that transfer to LCH was appropriate.

COMPARISON: 12/22/86          FINDINGS:     Lines/tubes:  None.          Lungs and pleura:  There is continued right mid and lower chest     opacity consistent with loculated pleural fluid and atelectasis.     This appearance of fluid has decreased slightly since the previous     study. There is no  pneumothorax. No focal consolidation is     demonstrated in the left hemithorax.  There may be a small     posterior left pleural effusion as well. There is subtle     suggestion of Kerley B lines at the lung bases consistent with     mild CHF.          Heart and mediastinum:  The heart and the mediastinum are     unchanged from the prior study. The aortic arch is calcified and     tortuous.          Bones:  The thoracic skeleton is unchanged from the prior study.          IMPRESSION:     Continued signs of atelectasis and pleural fluid involving     predominantly the right mid and lower hemithorax.  The appearance     of this has improved slightly since the prior exam.  No new focal     consolidation is demonstrated compared to the prior study.          There is subtle suggestion of Kerley B lines consistent with mild     CHF.     Plan:
1. Recurrent pleural effusion: for repeat CT chest. Continue treatment for CAP.
2. Hematuria: hold off Coumadin at present. Monitor Foley drainage. Consult Urology if no resolution. Otherwise for outpatient follow-up.
3. Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Alert Dr Joyce of admission as courtesy.
4. A Fib: rate controlled at present. Hold off Coumadin. 
5. HTN: BP poorly controlled. For admission anti-hypertensives. Monitor.
6. Psych: he appears depressed. Likely reactive to current poor health. I will alert PCP.
7. Code: FULL
8. Family: Daughter present and aware of plan
