Comment: I don't understand why someone downvote this question?

Answer: The problem here is, you can't send HTML email through `mail()`. You have to convert the HTML to plain text or use a library like [Swiftmailer](http://swiftmailer.org/).

See the [PHP manual page](http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.mail.php).

Comment: The link is for `mail()`

Comment: Thanks, i am using swiftmailer for send mail.

Comment: i am sending mail from codeigniter framework. and i need to show the html content.

Answer: You can try this:

\begin{code}
function mail_send($to,$subject,$body){
    $headers = "MIME-Version: 1.0\r\n";
    //$headers.= "Content-type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\r\n";
    $headers.= "From: yourname@yourdomain.com\r\n";
    $headers.= "Reply-to: yourname@yourdomain.com\r\n";
    $headers.= "Return-path: yourname@yourdomain.com\r\n";
    mail($to,$subject,$body,$headers);
}
\end{code}

Comment: i am already using your code. but its not working and mail not send to the receiver.

Comment: i am using codeigniter framework. its not sending the mail. i already used your code and tried but nothing.

Comment: Thanks. i am using swiftmailer for send mail.

Comment: You may be using swiftmailer for sending, But you are doing it wrong. Swiftmailer will not allow you to send an html email. See my answer for more details.

Answer: I am using this code for send mail:

\begin{code}
function mail_send($to,$subject,$body){
$headers = "MIME-Version: 1.0\r\n";
//$headers.= "Content-type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\r\n";
$headers.= "From: yourname@yourdomain.com\r\n";
//$headers.= "Reply-to: yourname@yourdomain.com\r\n";
$headers.= "Return-path: yourname@yourdomain.com\r\n";
mail($to,$subject,$body,$headers);
}
\end{code}

Answer: If your using a framework like Codeigniter you can use the following:

\begin{code}
$this->load->helper('text');
$this->load->library('mail');
$this->set_mail_from();
$this->load->library('swiftmailer');

$this->load->database();
$this->load->helper('form');
$this->load->helper('url');
$this->load->helper('date');

if($this->input->post('submit')){
$message = array('from' => $this->settings->get('email'),'to' => '','subject' => 'Your email Subject');
$body = array('name' => 'firstname.lastname','phone' => '0987654321','email' => 'email@example.com','message' => 'Your email Message',
'time' => date('Y/n/j h:i:s A'));

$this->load->library('captcha');
$data = array();
$captcha_response = $this->captcha->generate();
if ($captcha_response === false) return false;
$this->captcha->create($captcha_response, $this->config('captcha_img'), 'image/jpeg');
$data_captcha = $this->captcha->get_data($captcha_response);

$this->mail->from($this->config('from_email'));
$this->mail->to($this->input->post('to'));
$this->mail->subject($message['subject']);
$this->mail->message($message['from'], $message['to'], $message['subject'], $message, $message['time'], $data_captcha);

$this->mail->send();
\end{code}

Answer: i am using this code for sending mail.
