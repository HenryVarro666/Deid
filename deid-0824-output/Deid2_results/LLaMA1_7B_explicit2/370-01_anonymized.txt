She returns for follow-up visit.  She has essential hypertension
and diabetes and is s/p a small CVA.  Medications currently include
vasotec 20 b.i.d., chlorpropamide 250 b.i.d.  I once again

feeling in her stomach, but she is now agreeable to taking 80 mg

bruits.  Lungs clear.  Cardiac exam normal.  Unremarkable abdomen.
