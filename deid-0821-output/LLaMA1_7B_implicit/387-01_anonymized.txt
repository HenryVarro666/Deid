cystoscopy

Patient was placed in the supine  position and prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion.  Lidocaine jelly was inserted into the meatus for local anaesthesia.  A flexible cystoscope was inserted into the meatus.  The urethra was without lesions.  The lateral lobes of the prostate coapted at the midline.  The stent was identified and using alligator forceps the distal portion was grasped.  It was removed intact.  The patient tolerated the procedure and was discharged from the clinic after receiving ciprofloxacin.



Laboratory Values:

An independent review of a urinalysis shows:

                          No WBC's

                          +  RBC's

                          No Glucose

                          No Protein

                          Nitrite Negative

                          pH  7.0



Abdomen Single                 22-Mar-2081 

REPORT:

	History: As above.

	Comparison:Noncontrast CT abdomen and pelvis 3/14/81.

	Findings:

	There is a left ureteral stent.  Tiny residual stones seen on

	prior CT are not identified on this KUB.The bowel gas pattern is

	nonobstructive.      The bones are unremarkable in appearance. The

	visualized lung bases are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:

	LEFT URETERAL STENT.  NO ABNORMAL CALCIFICATIONS IDENTIFIED.

		

	

Impression:  50 yo male treated for a 1.1 cm symptomatic left renal stone.   His post-operative KUB does not show any calcifications.  The stent was removed intact without difficulty.   He is to have a follow up CT in June with and without contrast for further evaluation of a renal lesion seen on a previous CT scan.  He did have a post-operative CT that showed a subcapsular hematoma for which his blood pressure will be followed.   That study also showed the stone which is no longer visualized on todays KUB.  The imaging in June will again assess his stone burden.

        

Plan:   

1  CT abd/pelvis I-/I+ in June



Follow Up:  in June
