Reason for visit
	
  tc to review blood sugars and insulin titration

History of present illness
	
  S pt says he started Lantus 10 units at bedtime on 7/21/84 and his blood sugars have been am fastings a range of 114-213 and pm 180-270. 

Changes to Medications this visitLantus 16 units  sc qhs - change. (QTY:3-month supply Refills:3) do not mix with other insulins in same syringe 

Assessment and plan
	
  P I will increase his Lantus to 16 units at HS according to insulin titration algorithm and will call him in 1 week to further review blood sugars and titrate his insulin dose.

\subsection{Annotation and Evaluation}
In the annotation stage, each document is assigned with a random integer from $1$ to $50$. The integer is used to determine which of three types of annotations the document gets, i.e., a random number $r$ from $1$ to $5$ denotes patient age (annotated with age $[r]$\footnote{For example, the age $[1]$ is annotated as the age of the patient.}), a random number $r$ from $5$ to $15$, denotes the patient and doctor names (annotated as $[r] [doctor]$\footnote{For example, the age [1] and doctor [doctor] is annotated as the patient's doctor.}), and a random number $r$ from $15$ to $50$ denotes the patient's insulin titration algorithm (annotated as [redacted]), as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:redacted_note_annotation_example}.

\caption{Statistics of the number of annotation types for 170 notes.}\label{table:annotation_types}
\end{table}
The annotation of the clinical note by the human annotators is performed manually by the researchers. We manually annotate each note with one of the following types:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Patient age}: the type of annotation that the researchers use to annotate the patient's age, e.g., the age [redacted] in this clinical note, is annotated as the type of annotation [redacted].
\item \textbf{Patient and doctor names}: the type of annotation [redacted] patient and doctor names, e.g., [redacted] is annotated as the type of annotation [redacted].
\item \textbf{Patient’s insulin titration algorithm}: The type of annotation [redacted] is annotated as the type of annotation [redacted].
\end{itemize}
We provide the annotation type annotation in our dataset and we use it to compute the accuracy for the annotation.
We use the same set of annotations as the type of annotations for the patient's ages.

To measure the agreement, we use the same set of annotations as the type of the annotations for the patient's names and doctor's names.
To measure the agreement, we use the same set of annotations for the age.
To measure the agreement, we use the same set of the agreement, we use the same set of annotations.
To measure the agreement, we use the patient's name. Note:  To measure, we use the patient's, note, To measure, the name, or, the date, the name, To name or names, and age and the dates, the ages, the names and the name, the names, and the names.
