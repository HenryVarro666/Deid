HPI:  70 yo M with NIDDM admitted for cath after positive MIBI. Pt has had increasing CP and SOB on exertion for past two months, seen at PCP on 2/03 with EKG showing RBBB. Pt was scheduled for stress MIBI today to eval for cardiac ischemia. MIBI was reportedly stopped 2/2 to chest pain, though pt denies having pain during procedure. MIBI was read as positive for moderate to severe inferior ischemia and pt was referred to the ED for admission and catheterization.

MIBI: The patient has reduced exercise capacity (5 METS).  The ECG is positive for ischemia.  LV contractile function is normal. Findings are consistent with moderate to severe ischemia in the inferior and inferolateral ischemia at low work load (1.5 min EX). The LVEF is 52%.

EKG: Sinus arrhythmia with RBBB

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 

70 yo M with multiple cardiac risk factors and 2 mo escalating angina sx presents with MIBI positive for interior and inferiolateral ischemia.

CV:
	Ischemia: Hx angina, MIBI positive for inferior and inferiolateral ischemia. 
Cycle enzymes, plan for cath 2/18 to eval for reversible coronary defect. ASA.
	Pump: EF estimated at 52%
Cont enalapril, hctz
Rhythm: Sinus arrythmia and RBBB
Hold atenolol for bradycardia
DM
RISS
Prophy:
DVT prophylaxis: ambulatory
GI prophylaxis: Zantac

\subsection{Data and code} \label{datcode} The original text of the dataset is presented here for reference, together with its corresponding Python code and output. The original data was collected by a non-expert user in a real-world setting; the code here was written by the original author, who also verified the code's accuracy. In addition to the original dataset, we use the following dataset for experimentation, which we collected with the exact same procedure as for the original dataset, and which we also verified as being accurately written by the original author.
