\strong{Question:}

Does the following note (from the patient's medical record) contain any information about patient privacy and HIPAA?

Note that I have not included any patient information in the question.

What is the purpose of the redacted text in the clinical note?

Comment: This is probably not the answer, but the redacted information in the patient's medical record seems to be patient-identifying information, such as the name of the doctor and the clinic name.  If this is the case, there would be a legitimate concern that patient privacy and HIPAA regulation might be violated if patient-identifying information is included in a note about another patient.  This is just a guess, though, and I am not a lawyer; I am just trying to figure out why the clinical note might contain redacted patient information.

Comment: @MikeB: Thanks. I added the information about the clinician's name to the question to make it a bit more clear.

Comment: It is a little weird that "UHRICH, KARSON" is redacted.  Is this because "H" in "Karson" is also in "Hurst" and "Hospital", so it would be a HIPAA violation to include that information about the doctor's name?  The other redacted information is probably the clinic name, but if it were a hospital, I would expect to see the name in the note, since that would be important information for the doctor to have when writing an accurate clinical note.

Comment: @MikeB: No, there is no H in the name of the doctor (it is Karen). The patient is in a clinic, not a hospital, and the note above is from the patient's 5th chart note on that day. The 5th clinical note of the day was from Dr. Abreu, not Dr. Urlich.

Comment: The redacted information seems to be information about the clinician who wrote the clinical note.  The clinical note was written by a doctor named Abreu. The first line of the clinical note is "EDVISIT^45630268^UHRICH, KARSON".  It seems to me that the redacted part would be information about the person who wrote the note (e.g., "IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  This is a 71-year-old female with diabetes

presenting with cellulitis and some streaking.  She had received

IV Ancef in the emergency room.  She will be admitted for

continued IV antibiotics and observation.").  That is, I would imagine that the note writer's last name was redacted in case the note writer was a different doctor than Dr. Abreu, or a nurse practitioner or other medical professional.

Comment: @MikeB: Thanks for explaining that. It makes sense now.

Answer: I think the redacted text is patient identifying information. For example, in the clinical note, the redacted text includes the name of the clinician who wrote the clinical note, the date the note was added, and the patient number.  These are all pieces of information that could be used to track back to the patient in the medical system, even if the note itself does not include the patient-identifying information.
