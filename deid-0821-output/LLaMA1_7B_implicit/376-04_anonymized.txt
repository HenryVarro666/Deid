Freeman Internal Medicine Intern Admission Note


PATIENT:  Whitehead, Aidan D
MRN:  9855218
ADMIT DATE:  3/17/78
ATTENDING:  Bell, Charley
Source: Patient and chart


CC:  Diarrhea
HPI: 1M with DM, HTN, HL, and Parkinson's disease.  In 7/77, he had been treated at NAMG for a left lower lobe PNA with levofloxacin, and developed diarrhea while in the hospital.  After discharge, he continued to have profuse diarrhea, and was treated with IV hydration and metronidazole C. diff infection, first found to be positive on 7/31/77.  Since then he has had multiple episodes of recurrent C. diff.   Most recently, he was admitted to NAMG for treatment of recurrent C. diff in 1/77, with improvement after receiving inpatient vancomycin and flagyl, and discharged to NAMG, where he was for 3 weeks.  He received 21 days of flagyl.  After about two weeks, he noticed a gradual increase in his stool frequency.  Three weeks prior to admission, he began taking 500 mg PO Flagyl q8h, which he had at home.  He felt that his symptoms were improved somewhat on the flagyl.  One week ago, he saw his PCP, where a C. diff stool toxin was negative.   At that point, he stopped the PO flagyl, and shortly afterward his diarrhea again progressively worsened.  Currently he is having 10 BM per day, and he states that they are similar to odor, color, and frequency to his prior C. diff episodes.  He has also had a few days of lower abdominal pain, 2-3/10, with no clear pattern, and noticed a few flecks of blood in his stool 2 days ago on one occasion.   He denies other symptoms including fever/chills, n/v, cp, sob, and dizziness. He reports that when he had taken PO vancomycin in the past, it cost $40 per tablet.


ED:  Afebrile, HR 70s.  Hypertensive to 189/82. He was given 1000 cc NS, 5 mg PO amlodipine, 20 mg PO lisinopril, 500 mg IV flagyl.

RADIOLOGY:


3/17 KUB.  Study done, radiology read pending.


ECG:  Normal sinus rhythm, rate 84.  Normal axis.  Normal intervals.  No ST segment deviation or T wave inversion. 


ASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN:  81M with recurrent C. diff infections presenting with diarrhea.  Likely he has a recurrent episode of C. diff infection.  


1.  Diarrhea.  
- IV flagyl 500 mg Q8H and PO vancomycin 250 mg Q6H
- stool c. diff toxin
- ID consult re: appropriate management of multiply recurrent C. diff infection
- consider social services consult if ID feels PO vancomycin is the only viable option at this point. 


2. HTN
- HTN improved s/p receiving his home regimen in the ED.
- will replace atenolol with metoprolol while in-patient, up-titrate as needed, starting 37.5mg Q8h


3.  L lower extremity edema.  Patient states he was evaluated at OSH recently and felt to not have a DVT.  Will disuss whether any further workup is neeed with pt&#8217;s PCP in AM.


3.  FEN.  PO diet as tolerated.  RISS / NPH.


4.  PPX.  Lovenox.
