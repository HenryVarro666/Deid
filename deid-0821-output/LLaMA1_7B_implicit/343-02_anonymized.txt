KIM,DOUGLAS JR   201-63-51-2                VISIT DATE: 04/03/95

The patient was seen primarily by me. 

PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Fall, right knee injury.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Mr. Killian is a very pleasant 

54-year-old gentleman, with a history of diabetes, who had a fall 

on December 18, 2094.  At the time, he sustained an injury to his 

right knee which healed and then began to break down, and he 

developed a large wound which began draining and had foul odor.  

The patient had continued difficulty ambulating and presented to 

the emergency department for evaluation.  The patient denies having 

any hardware in his knee.  No history of osteomyelitis.  No 

hardware.  No history of peripheral neuropathy.  

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Patient denies any fevers or chills.  No nausea 

or vomiting.  No abdominal pain.  No chest pain or shortness of 

breath.  Patient is only complaining of difficulty ambulating 

secondary to the pain.   

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Two patellar tendon repairs at EDUCARE-PULLMAN in 2083, 

repair of a patellar fracture.  Recent diagnosis of diabetes, 

atrial fibrillation.  Hypertension, high cholesterol, and positive 

PPD.  

MEDICATIONS:  Please see nurses note for list of medications. 

ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN (rash). 

SOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient is a smoker.  He 

does not drink alcohol.  He works in engineering, and lives alone. 

Family history is noncontributory. 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  Patient is awake, alert, talking 

in full sentences, in mild distress secondary to pain.  VITAL 

SIGNS:  Afebrile, temperature 99.3, respiratory rate 20, blood 

pressure 161/96, pulse 95.  HEAD:  Atraumatic.  NECK:  Supple.  

LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation.  No wheezes, rales or rhonchi.  

HEART:  Regular rate.  No murmurs, gallops or rubs.  ABDOMEN:  

Soft, nontender.  SKIN:  A large ulcer to the right knee, right 

over the patella, with significant amount of break-down necrotic 

tissue and purulent discharge with a foul odor.  The depth of the 

wound is difficult to assess.  Intact motor function and sensation. 

Full flexion and extension of the knee, and evidence of well-healed 

midline scar above the ulcer.  NEURO:  Intact with good pulses 

palpable throughout.  

LABORATORY EVALUATION:  Plain film of the right knee, CT of the 

right knee, and laboratory values done.  Laboratory values 

demonstrated a white count of 14, ESR of 13, ESRP of 2.1.  Rest of 

the labs were normal except for an elevated glucose to 226.  Film 

of the knee shows patellofemoral arthritis with no evidence of 

osteomyelitis, no hardware seen.  CT of the knee showed a 

superficial ulcer to the depth of the patellar tendon but the 

patellar tendon itself was intact.  

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient was initially seen by 

orthopedic who felt that the ulcer was over the patellar tendon, at 

the site of prior surgeries, with no effusion or joint pain, and 

normal range of motion with joint involvement unlikely.  We are all 

very hesitant to tap this knee and it will not be done at this time 

for fear of introducing infection into the joint.  The patient is 

awaiting consultation by general surgery for probable admission and 

debridement in the operating room.  The plan at this time was to 

hold off on antibiotics.  Blood cultures were sent.  The patient is 

receiving IV fluids. 

CONSULTATIONS (including PCP):  Orthopedics, general surgery.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Knee ulcer.

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient was 

admitted and transitioned to ED Obs, awaiting evaluation by the 

surgical service for probable admission.  The patient is currently 

in stable and satisfactory condition, in Obs awaiting surgery 

evaluation.
