--------------History of Present Illness----------












Patient is an 80 year old male with history of hypertension, mild cognitive impairment with occasional delirium and a long list of medical problems that have been managed on an outpatient level by various providers over the past 20 years.









The patient's most recent medical problems include a diagnosis of hypertension made on 2083-08-15, anemia on 2083-10-09 (with HCTz initiation and recheck 2083-10-20) and a recent diagnosis of an acute urinary tract infection (UTI) (2083-10-11). The patient also has had a long-standing history of a peptic ulcer disease diagnosis with an upper endoscopy in 2069 that has been controlled with H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors.








The patient's family is well known to me from my years of practice in Blacksburg. I met the patient's daughter (Susan)  in 1989 and treated her husband (Robert) for 2 years beginning in 1987 for a history of diabetes.  The patient's daughter (Susan) called me in 2000 to say that her mother had become lost in the Blacksburg area, and I was able to help her find her way home.  The patient's daughter (Susan) again called me in 2007 to say that she had been trying to contact her father, but she had not been able to get a hold of him (despite multiple attempts) and she had a concern that something was wrong.  I was subsequently able to get in touch with Robert and was able to arrange for a social worker and a psychiatrist to see him at the hospital in Blacksburg on 2007-09-26.









The patient's son (William) was a patient in my practice from 1996-2004, and I last saw him on 2004-07-28.  William's daughter (Jane) was a patient in the practice as well from 2004-2001.  William's wife (Ann) was also a patient in the practice for 10 years and I last saw her on 2001-06-11.
