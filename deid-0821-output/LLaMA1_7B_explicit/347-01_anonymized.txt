bilateral carotid stenosis - status post right carotid 

endarterectomy, who was seen earlier today at Faith Hospital 

after an episode of word finding difficulty associated with acute 

vision loss in her left eye while riding as a passenger in a car.  

The event was witnessed and reportedly there was severe word 

finding difficulty.  The patient was transferred to the Bailey Memorial Hospital Emergency Department for further evaluation and 

management.  On arrival, she states her symptoms have largely
