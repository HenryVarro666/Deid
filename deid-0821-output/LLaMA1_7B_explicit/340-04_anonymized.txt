ENT-Sclera were white, fundi disc sharp, conjunctiva clear, tympanic membranes normal, ear canal AS somewhat red. The oropharynx was pink without exudate. The neck was supple with out adenopathy.

Impression

Ear- benign exam but symptomatic - try cortisporun otic

 

HTN- very high, no sign of end organ injury at this moment- will increase atenolol to 100, and have her rtc for recheck.  It would be helpful to know whether cramps came from hctz or amilodipine.
