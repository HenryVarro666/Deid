UMALI, DANA

12423229

09/20/2077





HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Umali returns for followup after her angioplasty of a superficial femoral artery occlusive disease, with a more proximal left iliac stent placement of the common iliac. She has a nonhealing left great toe ulceration. She is followed by Dr. Holden, and I performed an endovascular recanalization.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Today, she is doing well, after her procedure on 09/14/77.



IMAGING: Noninvasive vascular lab studies were performed today, showing an ABI on the left of 0.67 on the right of 0.42. This is a great improvement from the 0.24 ABI on the left before the endovascular procedure.



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Dr. Holden explained to the patient and family about toe amputation recommendations at this time. Otherwise, from a circulatory standpoint, we counseled them that this was the optimal time to perform toe amputation to allow for primary healing.



They will follow up with Dr. Holden in 2 weeks, once they decide.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Cruz returns with a new chief complaint of a large ulcer on a previous amputated toe. She also reports a wound infection of a previous left leg amputation. She has a history of multiple left leg amputations for diabetes and venous stasis.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is currently hospitalized with wounds to both left feet with noninfectious ulcers with necrosis and infection. On the left leg that was amputated on 09/08/2077, a noninfectious ulcer with nonhealing tissue loss of the metatarsal area. There is a wound on this leg from a prior ulceration, which appears to be infected and with a deep wound infection. The patient has a nonamputated foot on this leg, which also has ulceration, necrosis and infection.




ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: The wound on the left leg that was amputated on 09/08/2077 is a noninfectious ulcer with nonhealing tissue loss of the metatarsal area. On the left leg that was amputated, the ulcer from a prior ulceration is worsening with an eschar and infection with a deep wound infection. The ulcerations on both legs are being managed with topical ointment, and the left leg is being managed with an oral regimen of a broad-spectrum antibiotic. We will follow up with these patients in a week and discuss a more aggressive regimen for the ulcers.
