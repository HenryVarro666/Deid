Mr. Olive was seen with Dr. Innis in general neurology clinic on 07/11/55.   Dr. Innis was present for or performed all salient aspects of the history and physical exam and together we discussed with the patient the work-up and treatment plan. 



Return visit.

Mr. Olive is a 71y old RHM, with Idiopathic Parkinson's disease. He was started on Sinemet 25/100mg tid with significant improvement in his balance & gait & rest tremor. However there were still periods of shuffling & stumbling especially going down slope. He also complained of persistant fatigue in his legs. We started him on Amantadine 100mg tid during his last visit. He did not tolerate it well & complained of dizziness especially when he goes out, even with reduced dose of 100mg bid. He has discontinued it since then.

He is tolerating Sinemet well, no hallucinations, on-off phenomenon. He does not notice any wearing off of the effect prior to next dose. No dyskinesias.

No new Neurological symptoms. He still has poor balance but his posture is much improved.
