The above example was created using OpenMRS, a free and open-source Electronic Medical Record. The original clinical note was provided by the OpenMRS Developer Network as part of a competition to develop a clinical note for OpenMRS.

The original clinical note is in plain language and uses the term "Dr." instead of "M.D.", "D.O." or another abbreviation for a licensed physician. The note includes the physician's address, the hospital where he or she practices, and his or her specialty; however, no other information about the physician is included. The patient's name and age are omitted, and only the initial of the patient's last name and a random string are included to protect the patient's identity. The note includes only the problem list and the history of present illness. The patient's medications are not listed, as it is not the purpose of this example to illustrate the use of an EMR. Instead, we are using the clinical note to show how the clinical information in a plain language note can be represented in a structured form (the problem list and history of present illness) that can be processed by a clinical natural language processing system.

The structured data representation of the clinical note was created using OpenMRS, an open source Electronic Medical Record (EMR) developed by OpenMRS Inc. The structuring rules are based on SNOMED RT 2005 (http://www.ihtsdo.org/snomed-rt/home.html) and ICD-10-CM (http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/). For each clinical concept in the clinical note, the system automatically selects the most specific term from the clinical vocabularies. The example was written in the SNOMED RT clinical language, using the SNOMED RT terms for the problem list and history of present illness.

The following section describes the structured representation of a plain language problem list, the plain language history of present illness, and the clinical data in plain language.

### Representation of Plain Language Problem List in Structured Data

The problem list is the list of problems that are the reason the patient is seeking medical care. Each problem can be described in plain language (i.e., natural language) using a sentence or two of description, or it can be represented using one of the problem list templates described in the ICPC-2 PLUS. For instance, we might have the following problem list:

* Myocardial infarction
* Chronic renal insufficiency
* Congestive heart failure
* Hypertension

The problem list could be represented in structured data using SNOMED RT or ICD-10-CM. We use the SNOMED RT clinical language (SRL). SRL uses SNOMED RT and ICD-10-CM terms to represent the patient's problems in a structured form. In this example, the problems are all represented by SNOMED RT terms. The plain language problem list is the same as the structured data representation, except that we include some extra information (the patient's name):

* Myocardial infarction
* Chronic renal insufficiency
* Congestive heart failure
* Hypertension

* Mr. Gary O
* John Doe

### Representation of Plain Language History of Present Illness in Structured Data

We would also like to represent the history of present illness in structured data. This would include information about the patient's symptoms and any relevant past medical history. In addition, we might like to know when the patient's current condition is acute or subacute rather than chronic. For instance, the patient's history of present illness might be:

* Mr. John Doe
* 56 years old
* Myocardial infarction
* Chronic renal insufficiency
* Congestive heart failure
* Hypertension
* Diagnosed 2083-07-26

* John Doe
* 56 years old
* Myocardial infarction
* Chronic renal insufficiency
* Congestive heart failure
* Hypertension
  * New diagnosis in 2083-07-26

* John Doe
* 56 years old
* Myocardial infarction
* Chronic renal insufficiency
* Congestive heart failure
* Hypertension
  * New diagnosis in 2083-07-26

We can represent this history of the present illness in a structured data format in a structured data.
