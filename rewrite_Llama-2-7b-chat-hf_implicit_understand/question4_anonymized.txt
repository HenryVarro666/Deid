Mansfield, NV 29473                                      56040785
-----------                                           12/08/86


INTERVAL HISTORY:  The patient is status post one lumbar epidural
injection.  He is 61 years old with previous history of diabetes,
as well as bilateral fem-pop surgery.  He has pain radiating to
both legs up to calves and thighs.  He has moderate-to-severe
spinal stenosis.  He had good response to L5-S1 epidural steroid
injection once, about 3 months ago.  He states that he is
reasonably symptom free but the pain is coming back.  Today, we
are going to repeat the injection.

I have a few questions for the patient:

1. How is your pain level now compared to when you first came in?
2. Have you noticed any improvement in your symptoms since your last injection?
3. Are you currently taking any medications for your pain?
4. Have you had any recent changes in your medication regimen?
5. How many days a week are you experiencing pain?
6. How long have you been experiencing pain?
7. Have you noticed any relationship between your pain and your mood?
8. Have you noticed any relationship between your pain and your sleep?
9. Have you noticed any relationship between your pain and your activity level?
10. Are there any other symptoms you are experiencing besides pain?
