to hospitalization this spring down in West Virginia.  Unfortunately, I
do not have records but there was some question of whether this
was related to asthma, allergies or CHF.  He has had two pillow
orthopnea and worsening edema than in the past.  He has also
noted some more exertional dyspnea.  He denies cough, wheeze,
hemoptysis.  ? PND.

5.   Diabetes mellitus.  Continues on oral agents and has been
quite good with his diet.  Weight is actually down 10 pounds

femoral bruits but no complaints of claudication.  

9.   Osteoarthritis/left knee pain.  He is status post left TKR
by Dr. Robles last year.  Unfortunately had a knee injury down in
West Virginia this spring and has quite a bit of problem with swelling
and pain.  He was seen by Dr. Robles who treated him briefly with
Vioxx but this caused significant worsening lower extremity edema
and decreased urine output requiring its discontinuation.  He is
now carefully using ibuprofen and has follow up scheduled with
Dr. Robles.

proteinuria.  Biopsy consistent with diabetic nephropathy.

                           OFFICE NOTE

Opal Fierro
MR#: 1131414
July 7, 2090

Reason for visit: Follow-up of patient with history of CHF,
CAD, CMCAD, hyperlipidemia, hypertension.  

He was noted to have mild edema bilaterally and no new signs
or symptoms of CHF, CHF exacerbation, or angina.  He was
followed with diuretics and his edema improved.  His LV function
improved on AICD, beta blocker therapy and Lasix, but he was
discontinued due to poor adherence to meds and poor diet.  The
cardiothoracic surgeon is following for the pacer and is
concerned about the pacer placement given the poor LV performance
and the fact that the pacer wires are located in a very
compromised region.  The AICD was not triggered and he denies
pain.  He has had no chest x-rays or EKGs in the past year. He
denies any recent episodes of angina despite the recent history
of an episode while in the hospital this spring.

He has not had any recent episodes of pulmonary edema despite
the recent history of CHF.  He has not had any new episodes of
hypertension.  His weight and blood pressure are both down from
the last time we saw him.  He continues on a very low-salt
diet with occasional salt shaker usage and is very careful to
limit his fluid intake.  His blood pressure has been quite well
controlled on a combination of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide.

He reports that he has not felt well since his visit with me last
fall.  He is concerned that he is gaining weight.  He continues
to have some fatigue, but he reports that he is much more fatigued
now then he was last fall at the time of our visit.  He also notes
that he has some swelling in his left lower extremity.  

His cholesterol is now 204 on Lipicor. He reports that he is taking
10,000 units of vitamin D, 1000 units of vitamin A, 2
griselin, 20 mg of fish oil per day, and he was advised
that he was on the right track. His HDL 50.  Triglycerides 188. 
Hemoglobin 14.3, hematocrit 37.  Platelet count 240.
White cell count 70.
