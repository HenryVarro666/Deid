Please see the note for full details.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This patient is a very pleasant 

gentleman accompanied by his wife who gives most of the history 

complaining of bleeding in the right groin.  He is status post 

catheterization and stent approximately two weeks.  He was recently 

discharged from rehabilitation and at home his wife found the right 

groin to be soaked in blood.  The patient's wife also noticed some 

swelling at the site.  He has had no fevers and no chills.  He has 

recently been diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome with white 

counts in the 30's.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Review of systems is notable for bleeding only. 

He denies any abdominal pain.  He denies any fever or chills.  No 

neurologic complaints.  No distal neurovascular complaints either.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient's past medical history is 

notable for diabetes, hypertension as well as cerebrovascular 

accident, gastrointestinal bleed and myelodysplasia.  Surgeries and 

procedures are as above.

MEDICATIONS:  The patient's medications include Plavix and aspirin.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no allergies. 

SOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  No current tobacco or ethyl 

alcohol.  He lives at home with his wife.  He has VNA services 

although they are not coming tomorrow.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  I agree with the physical examination as 

documented.  GENERAL:  The patient is an awake, alert, pleasant 

male in no apparent distress.  VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 96, pulse 

56, respiratory rate 20, blood pressure 97/49, oxygen saturation 

96%.  EXTREMITIES:  The right groin shows a slightly tender area 

with a little bit of ooze but dried blood.  No active bleeding 

right now.  Distally he has popliteal pulses.  He has bilateral 

dopplerable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses.  He has 

full range of motion and denies any numbness.  

LABORATORY EVALUATION:  Basic laboratory studies here show a 

hematocrit of 28 and a white count of 43.  His white count is up 

from a baseline of about 33.  His baseline hematocrit is 30.  His 

platelets are 291.  His right groin ultrasound is negative for 

pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula.

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient is being sent home.  We 

are arranging VNA to follow up tomorrow.

CONSULTATIONS (including PCP):  The patient's primary care 

physician was called for coverage for Dr. Duong.

resolved.

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient was
