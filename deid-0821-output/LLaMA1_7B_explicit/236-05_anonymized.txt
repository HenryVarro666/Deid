Dear Wanda:

Mr. Vance returns for followup.  Since last seen, she apparently was recently seen in the walk-in clinic in your office complaining of profound fatigue and depression.  She wonders if she was having a flare of her porphyria.  Apparently, her examination at that time was relatively benign, and no specific new findings were noted.  After talking with Dr. Vogt at that office visit, she felt modestly improved, and over the past few weeks feels that her energy level has returned to its baseline.  Lab studies obtained at that time revealed creatinine 0.9, glucose elevated at 236, hematocrit of 43, with a white count 10.  As no specific pathology was noted, she was sent home without any change in her medical regimen.

Currently, she continues on Lantus insulin 20 units subcutaneous. q.p.m., Celexa 40 mg p.o. q.d., enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d., Flonase 1-2 puffs p.o. q.d., isosorbide mononitrate 60 mg p.o. q.d., Neurontin 600 mg p.o. t.i.d., nitroglycerin p.r.n. which she has not had to take, lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d., furosemide 20 mg p.o. q.d., and p.r.n. Motrin.

Physical exam reveals a thin woman in no acute distress.  Blood pressure right arm sitting 105/78, heart rate 70 and regular, respirations 14 and unlabored, and weight is pending.  The neck is supple.  JVP is flat.  Carotids are 2+ with very soft bilateral referred murmurs.  Chest is clear.  Cardiac exam shows normal S1, physiologically split S2 with 1/6 systolic ejection murmur radiating from the apex to the base, and a 1-2/6 holosystolic murmur radiating from the apex to the axilla.  No significant diastolic murmur or rub.  The abdomen is benign.  Extremities reveal trace bipedal edema.  Peripheral pulses are diminished but detectable.

Electrocardiogram is pending.

Impression:  Ms. Vance remains relatively stable from a cardiovascular perspective.  However, as you know, her last echocardiogram did show evidence of at least moderate mitral regurgitation with significantly reduced left ventricular systolic function.  She has made it quite clear that under no circumstances would she consider repeat cardiac surgery to treat her valvular heart disease.  Nonetheless, I think it would be helpful for her to undergo repeat echocardiogram to help gauge the current status of her left ventricle and degree of regurgitation, which may allow for additional modifications to her therapeutic regimen.  Beyond this, her condition is actually relatively stable from a cardiovascular standpoint.  I have not further altered her medical regimen.

Thank you very much for allowing me to assist in her care.

Sincerely yours,

Dear Timothy:

Thank you for your note regarding the results of the recent echocardiogram performed on Ms. Vance.  It was reassuring to find that she does not have any significant regurgitation or evidence of pulmonary hypertension at the present time.  In addition, the ejection fraction continues to be in the 20% range.

However, I did note an additional significant change.  There was now a large amount of mitral stenosis with severe regurgitation.  It is difficult to determine whether this change is due to disease progression and further valvular insufficiency or due to a more significant degree of hypertension and pulmonary hypertension.  The transthoracic echocardiogram showed mild tricuspid insufficiency with minimal mitral regurgitation.  In addition, I noted an increase in her right ventricular size and function.  I would have to think that the significant amount of mitral stenosis and regurgitation would be the result of an increase in the right ventricle.

I have not altered her current medications.  However, I think it might be prudent to consider an addition to the regimen.  I am recommending that she be started on Lasix 40 mg. daily.  This is a very small dose for a diuretic with the intention of increasing her urine output.  If this is found to be helpful, I think it would be reasonable to consider doubling the dose over the next month.

Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks again!

Sincerely yours,
