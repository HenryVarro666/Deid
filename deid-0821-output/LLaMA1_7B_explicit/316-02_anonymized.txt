PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Foot ulcer.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This is a 78-year-old gentleman 

who is a diabetic developed left foot ulcer six weeks ago after he 

had shaving of some calluses by a podiatrist.  The wound has not 

healed and then got infected.  He was started on Keflex, then when 

the initial cultures came back showing resistance to Keflex so he 

was switched to Cipro, however, his final cultures showed MRSA.  He 

comes in with increasing redness and pain.

disease, mitral regurgitation, anemia, sleep apnea and pulmonary 

hypertension.

toes.  There was some mild surrounding cellulitis.  He had 3+ pedal 

edema.  The casts were symmetric and nontender.  There is no 

adenopathy.
