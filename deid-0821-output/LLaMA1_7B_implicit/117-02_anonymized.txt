Procedure:  The patient is a 71 year old Spanish-speaking female scheduled for right colectomy.  Surgery is scheduled on May 31, 2066 by Dr. Patrick Frantz.



Chief Complaint & Present Illness:  Patient reports that she was having difficulty with constipation and colonoscopy was scheduled 5/07/66.  Colonoscopy showed a malignant appearing tumor or possibly a villous adenoma in the cecum.  Pathology revealed adenocarcinoma.



Patient reports a history of angina stating that it is usually precipitated by stress or anxiety as well as exertion.  Describes angina as left-sided anterior chest pain that is stabbing in nature and constant.  Sometimes she gets relief from this pain by applying pressure to chest with her hand.  However, if pain is severe enough she usually takes one nitroglycerin tablet.  Occasionally nausea will accompany chest pain.  States pain occurs most frequently at night and she usually confines herself to taking nitroglycerin tablets only at night, not with daytime pain.  Most recent stress test done 11/63 showed that patient had a normal exercise capacity, METS=8,  EKG that was negative for ischemia in response to stress, and myocardial scans were within normal limits and did not show evidence of ischemia or infarction.  Cardiac ultrasound done 10/62 showed a normal left ventricular size and systolic function, no segmental wall motion abnormalities, and an EF of 62%.



Patient reports that she developed a cough approximately two weeks ago productive of white/tan sputum.  She also has nasal discharge that is yellowish in color.  Was evaluated at the urgent care clinic 5/20/66 no antibiotics were started.  Patient denies fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.
