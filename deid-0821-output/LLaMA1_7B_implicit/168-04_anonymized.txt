     This assay is very sensitive to morphine and codeine. The assay is less

     sensitive to oxycodone. Large quantities of oxymorphone and/or meperidine

     can also cause positive results.

Studies:	

CT I -: NO SIGNIFICANT INTERVAL CHANGE FROM THE PRIOR STUDY.  NO ACUTE INTRACRANIAL FINDINGS.



CXR: Cardiomegaly with interstitial pulmonary edema.  The findings

	are more prominent then the prior study from 4/27/73 x-ray.

              

EKG:  NSR 72 with TWF in I and TWI in L unchanged from 9/18



Impression: 

55 yo male with multiple medical problems presents from rehab facility with recurrence of shaking activity. His current exam is c/w encephalopathy with no focal neurological deficits. The patient has multiple reasons to be encephalopathic including renal insufficiency, opiate withdrawal or hypertensive encephalopathy. He does not appear to be having seizures because his movements are not rhythmic and are altered during interactions with examiners.

 

Recommendations: 

-   check UA, NH3

-   lower systolic blood pressure to below 200, e.g. with Labetalol.

-   Give 2g MgSO4 (given renal insuff), follow Mg bid and dose Mg bid to keep level at high end of normal.

-  Check EEG to assess for epileptiform activity

-  Check MRI/A to assess for posterior leukoencephalopathy



This case was discussed with the ED neurology senior resident Dr Benjamin Iles 



Thank you for this interesting consult.
