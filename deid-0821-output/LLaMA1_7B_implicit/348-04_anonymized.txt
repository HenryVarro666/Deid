Disposition and Plans

 1.   Routine health-scheduled mammogram, colonoscopy.

2.  type2 DM-she will continue her current diet and medications and see Carolyn Delong, nutritionist monthly to check on blood sugars and adjust as needed.

3.  HTN is under excellent control.  If she develops any new symptoms or changes in blood pressure, she should see Dr. Gina Chu.  If she has any difficulty with the metformin, we can start the pioglitazone.  I would like her to continue the metformin, but I am willing to try the pioglitazone if she has problems with the metformin.  I would like to start her on a statin.  She had a lipids of 987.  We will recheck in 6 months.  Check her thyroid levels and her vitamin D and DHEAs.
