Mr. Tanner RTC to discuss diabetes, BP, weight, lipids.



HPI: He has been overweight for some time, and was found to have DM II about two years ago. I had treated him with:

GLYBURIDE  5MG PO BID

METFORMIN  500MG PO TID

LISINOPRIL  40MG PO QD

DILTIAZEM CD  180MG PO QD

HCTZ  12.5MG PO QD



however he enrolled in a study, and when it was over he was put on:



DILTIAZEM CD 180 MG     PO QD 

HYZAAR (25 MG/100 MG) (HCTZ 25MG   LOSART... 1 TAB     PO QD 



When I found his A1c to be 8.7%, I added back 5 mg QD of glyburide which he has been taking for < 1 month. He feels well. He says he's lost 10 lbs. since his last visit (262 lbs. on 2/26 - 263 lbs. today) but he's interested in a weight loss program.



MEDICATIONS

DILTIAZEM CD 180 MG     PO QD 

HYZAAR (25 MG/100 MG) (HCTZ 25MG   LOSART... 1 TAB     PO QD 

GLYBURIDE 5 MG     PO QD

Plan:

1. by his account DM control is still poor, which is not surprising since he previously required 10 mg of glyburide and 1500 mg of metformin per day. For now I will increase glyburide to 5 mg BID.

2. also poor BP control for a diabetic. Increasing Diltiazem to 240 mg QD. It's unfortunate that he was taken off lisinopril.

3. MALB has improved but is still high; reports suggest Diltiazem might help with this.

4. discussed necessity for weight loss for DM, BP, lipids.

5. RTC 1 month.
