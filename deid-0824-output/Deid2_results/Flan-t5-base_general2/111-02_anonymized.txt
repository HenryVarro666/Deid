This is a preliminary dictation. 

PRESENTING COMPLAINT and HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This 

patient is a [redacted][redacted] with a history of hypertension and 

diabetes who presents with fever and chills.  He is four weeks 

status post revision of an aorto-bifemoral bypass graft, which got 

infected and had to be revised.  He has been doing well, but now 

presents here with a low-grade fever to 1[redacted][redacted].9 degrees F. (he states 

his maximum temperature at home was 1[redacted]1 degrees F., while he was 

taking Advil for the fever).  He presents for evaluation.  He has 

had no drainage from the site, and has been home on IV Nafcillin 

for the past two months secondary to his graft infection. 

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As above. 

MEDICATIONS:  IV Nafcillin, Lasix, Zocor, and insulin. 

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies. 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The vital signs include a blood pressure of 

179/85, a pulse of 91, respirations of 2[redacted], and a fever to 1[redacted][redacted].9 

degrees F.  The HEENT examination is normal.  There are some 

crackles at the left base, but the lungs are otherwise normal.  The 

heart has a regular rate and rhythm.  The abdomen is soft and 

non-tender, with good bowel sounds.  There is a right groin mass, 

questionably a hematoma, with good pulses however.  The extremities 

are well-perfused. 

LABORATORY EVALUATION:  The electrolytes, BUN, and creatinine are 

normal.  The blood sugar is 18[redacted].  The white count is normal at 3.7. 

The hematocrit is 29.  The PT/PTT are pending.  The urinalysis is 

negative so far, with microscopic pending. 

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient was seen by Surgery. 

The consensus was to order a CT scan of the abdomen, since the 

patient had a fever at that point, and so the CT scan is pending. 

Thus, the assessment was that this was a [redacted][redacted] with a 

history of a recent revision of an aorto-bifemoral bypass graft, 

who had been on two months of IV Nafcillin, and who presented with 

a fever.  Laboratory studies are done and cultures sent.  A Surgery 

consultation and abdominal CT scan were ordered, and results were 

pending.  The patient was admitted to the Emergency Department 

Observation Unit awaiting the scan, full evaluation, and 

disposition.  The patient was signed out to the 3 p.m. attending. 

CONSULTATIONS (INCLUDING PCP):  Surgery. 

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Fever. 

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient is 

admitted to the Emergency Department Observation Unit in stable 

condition.
