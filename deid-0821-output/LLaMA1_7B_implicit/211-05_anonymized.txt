   Follow-up

Physical examination:

			

-Pulse: 58  beats per minute and regular

-Neck:   His JVP is 4 cm. No carotid bruits

-Chest:   Clear to auscultation bilaterally.

-Cardiac:   Regular in rhythm, but bradycardic. Normal S1 and S2. He has no S3 or S4. He has no audible murmurs.

-Abdomen:   Soft. It is neither tender nor distended.

-Extremities:   Warm and well perfused. No edema.

-BP: 120/72  mmHg. 



			EKG:

   Sinus bradycardia. Otherwise normal



			Assessment and plan:

   Overall, Mr. Urban is doing very well. He continues to be very active with no symptoms of angina or congestive heart failure. Currently, his lipids are under excellent control as is his blood pressure. Ongoing secondary prevention and risk factor modification will continue to be paramount in Mr. Urban's care. I have discussed these issues with him in detail. 



I would like to obtain another echocardiogram to re-assess his ejection fraction which has been low in the past.  Also, I would like to see if he has had further development of pulmonary hypertension.  He will continue his current medications and return to see me in six months' time or sooner if need be.
