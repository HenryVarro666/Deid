Reason for Visit Followup History of Present Illness S/p Cath with stents, no pain since per pt, but wife says he does have pain sometimes which is relieved by resting.  He denies any significant pain and denies any associated sx.  He attributes the sensation to anxiety. He has a stress test next week.  Dicsused potential hazards of ignoring pain, which could be a sign of blockage in one of the stents.

Pt reports increased feelings depression recently.  Continues meds, continues with psych.  - Dr Godwin @  Whitney St; counselling w/ Vaughn.  Sober x 5 years.
