RADIATION ONCOLOGY FOLLOW-UP NOTE


HEATH, QUINTEN M. 805-94-75


REFERRING PHYSICIAN: Fred Quebedeaux, M.D.


DATE OF VISIT: 2/4/2173


REASON FOR VISIT: Reassessment of progress, s/p postoperative adjuvant radiation therapy in combination with concurrent chemotherapy for esophageal adenocarcinoma, T2N1 stage IIB, s/p left thoracoabdominal esophagectomy (12/01/69) with pathologic tumor stage T2N1M0 (3/23 involved lymph nodes).


POSTOPERATIVE RADIATION THERAPY:  For the presence of metastatic disease in regional lymph nodes, he was judged a candidate for postoperative adjuvant chemo-radiation therapy.  He was treated with a total dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions to the tumor bed region using IMRT, planned with 4D CT simulation.  This treatment was administered in combination with chemotherapy between March 29, 2170, and Apr 30, 2170.  


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Quinten Heath is a 77 year-old gentleman with a history of smoking, chronic GERD, HTN, CAD s/p PCI, partially blocked L carotid artery and AAA repair x 2.  He was in his USOH until 8/69 when he began to have difficulty swallowing.  While eating a hamburger he felt it lodge in his chest with accompanying retrosternal discomfort and increased salivation.  He has had about a dozen similar episodes since then, which have generally resolved within 10-15 minutes without regurgitation.  In 9/69 his PCP prescribed a PPI, which helped somewhat, but he continued to have dysphagia.  On 10/16/69 EGD at Griffin Hospital demonstrated a partially-obstructing distal esophageal mass 34-39 cm from the incisors, associated with Barrett&#8217;s esophagus, with pathology significant for well differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma.  On 10/17/69 CT of the chest and abdomen showed prominent thickening of the distal esophagus.  On 10/21/69 repeat CT of the chest showed an 8 mm LLL nodule and R-sided pleural thickening.  Upper EUS showed a partially obstructing esophageal mass extending from 35-40 cm with 9 mm thickness, suggestive of invasion to the muscularis propria, one suspicious mediastinal LN, and porta hepatis adenopathy.  On 10/22 FNA of a porta hepatis LN was negative.


He underwent a left thoracoabdominal esophagectomy on 12/1/69. Pathology showed an ulcerated tumor measuring 4.0x3.5x0.8 cm, invading into muscularis propria (pT2) and metastasis to 3 of 27 LN (N1).  


INTERVAL HISTORY/REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: 
He has been doing well without significant GI or respiratory symptoms.
He has maintained steady energy and appetite.
He has had mild dysphagia for solid and meat. Otherwise, he has been doing well.
He denies significant respiratory symptoms. No focal or generalized neurological symptoms. The remainder of review of systems was unremarkable.
