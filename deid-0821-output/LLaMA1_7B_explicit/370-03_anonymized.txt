UMALI, DANA

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Umali returns for followup after her angioplasty of a superficial femoral artery occlusive disease, with a more proximal left iliac stent placement of the common iliac. She has a nonhealing left great toe ulceration. She is followed by Dr. Holden, and I performed an endovascular recanalization.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Today, she is doing well, after her procedure on 09/14/77.



IMAGING: Noninvasive vascular lab studies were performed today, showing an ABI on the left of 0.67 on the right of 0.42. This is a great improvement from the 0.24 ABI on the left before the endovascular procedure.



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Dr. Holden explained to the patient and family about toe amputation recommendations at this time. Otherwise, from a circulatory standpoint, we counseled them that this was the optimal time to perform toe amputation to allow for primary healing.



They will follow up with Dr. Holden in 2 weeks, once they decide.







Vernon Ramses Cruz, M.D.








REASON FOR VISIT: followup on toe amputation













PROGNOSIS: good prognosis for wound healing



RECOMMENDATIONS: return to see the primary care physician in 2 weeks to discuss toe amputation












DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: toe amputation

Comment: Thank you for the reply. I have added the code.

Comment: @Maria, it's a very long text. I don't think we would want to reproduce it here.

Answer: This is what I came up with.  I don't have `lipsum10` installed on my system, so I used `article` class, which uses the same layout.  I added the `textpos` package to allow for positioning the lines of text.  I also used `\vfil`, which puts a line-break, but the line number is still in the same column.  It also allows for lines of text to be longer, if needed, without breaking out of a column of text.  I also used `\textup` to set a text-face to bold-face.

\begin{code}
\documentclass[letterpaper,12pt]{article}
\usepackage{lipsum10}
\usepackage{textpos}
\newcommand{\line}[1]{%
  \vfil\textup{#1\nobreakspace}\hfill}

\begin{document}

%%\lipsum[1-12]

\begin{linenumbers}
\begin{description}
\lipsum[1-8]
\end{description}

%\line{Line number 40}
%%\line[\hfill]{40}
% \line[{40}]
\lipsum[9-16]
%%\line{Line number 40}
%%\line[{40}]
\lipsum[17-21]
\end{linenumbers}

%\line[45]
%%\line[45][40]
\begin{linenumbers}
% \line[{40}]
%%\vfil[45]\nobreakspace
\lipsum[34-40]
\end{linenumbers}

\end{document}
\end{code}

Comment: Thank you. This does not work for my case, but it does the job for others to see what to do.
