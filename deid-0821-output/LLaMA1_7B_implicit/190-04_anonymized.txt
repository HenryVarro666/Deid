CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Mr. Nicholas Xavier is a 73-year-old man who
returns to the Orlando Regional today for a quick follow up on his
left foot ulceration.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Glucovance 5/500 mg b.i.d. and Actos 30 mg
q.d.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The ulceration has not significantly
changed, but there are no new signs of infection.  He has been
taking Keflex 500 mg t.i.d. for the last seven days.  He denies
fever and his blood glucose levels have started to improve a
little bit.  His fingerstick blood sugar today is 145.

He has an appointment in Vascular Surgery in two days.  I have
asked him that it is extremely important for him to keep that
appointment for the evaluation of this ulceration and his
vascular status.  I have also reviewed with him that he may need
to be hospitalized if a vascular procedure is recommended.

Unfortunately, he does not have an appointment with Podiatry
until the end of this month.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  He will be seen by me again in a few days
after he is seen in Vascular Surgery.  In the meantime, he will
continue with all his medications.  I have given him a
prescription for Zocor 20 mg q.d. since the pharmacy could not
give him Lipitor that I had prescribed.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Patient is a 56-year-old man who presents with a
feverish, ill appearing patient with a new ulceration on his right
foot.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Glucovance 5/500 mg t.i.d. and Actos 20
mg t.i.d.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient's temperature has dropped to
102.  Patient is complaining of an increase in his left foot
ulceration.  He has been given Keflex 500 mg q.d. for the last
four days, but the ulceration has grown in diameter and
appears deeper.  His fingerstick blood glucose today is 280.

He also has been complaining of a headache since yesterday.
He denies any fever.  He reports his last glucose level as
180.  His hemoglobin A1c is 10%.

I have ordered a complete blood count to evaluate for a low blood
cell count and an urinalysis and culture to evaluate for infection.
The patient has an appointment in Vascular Surgery next week in an
effort to try to get to the bottom of this ulceration.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  I have given him an appointment with
Podiatry next week as well as in Vascular Surgery.  I have also
given him an appointment with the Diabetic Clinic for a
comprehensive evaluation of this problem.  The patient has
agreed to go to the Diabetic Clinic on Monday as a precaution to
try to get his glucose levels under better control.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient is a 92-year-old man with
progressive difficulty in walking due to his feet.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Glucovance t.i.d. and Actos 5 mg t.i.d.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is here for a routine
follow up visit.  He has a progressive foot wound which has
been drained and dressed for the last five days.  It has become
larger in size in that time, but he does not have any new
symptoms.  I am going to send him back to the vascular surgeon
in two weeks since this patient has difficulty walking.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  The patient needs to be sent back to
vascular surgery in order to evaluate this foot ulceration and
his vascular status.
