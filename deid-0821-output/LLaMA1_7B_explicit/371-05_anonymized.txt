 71F w/ MMPs returns to clinic for a routine f/u visit.

Since I last saw her, she has made some nice strides.  Her breathing and ability to exert herself is significantly better w/ BP control, diuretics, control of gerd, and mild weight loss.
She had a sling placed for incontinence which has helped. She also has some improved back pain w/ lidoderm patches and prn oxycodone.

She had a sleep study recently confirming the presence of sleep apnea.

1)CV: Pt has diastolic CHF, w/ vol status cont to be improved on exam w/ almost no le edema on lasix (minimal hjr). She still c/o doe but even this is much improved.
