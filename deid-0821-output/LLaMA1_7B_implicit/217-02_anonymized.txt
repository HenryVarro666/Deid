I tried the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item I added `\hfill\null` after `\end{document}` in the first file (`main.tex`)
\item Added `\begin{document}` before the `\newpage` in the second file (`notes.tex`)
\end{itemize}

None of these worked and I'm stuck. Can someone please help?

Comment: What you have to do is make sure the page break happens at the right places. The first one is at `\newpage` (or `\cleardoublepage`, whichever you are using), the second is at `\end{document}`. You can use `\newpage` or `\cleardoublepage` in `main` and `\end{document}` in `notes`, or the other way around.

Comment: @egreg: Thank you so much. It works now. Can you please provide more details as to why this works? I'm not sure how you know that this will work.

Comment: @egreg: I was also wondering, if the page break happens at the right place, why did adding a `\par\newpage` in `notes.tex` not work?

Comment: `\par\newpage` won't work. `\par` is a line break, `\newpage` is a page break.

Comment: @egreg: Thank you once again. So basically the `\par` breaks the paragraph and then `\newpage` is added to break the page (i.e two page breaks)?

Comment: The `\par` breaks the current paragraph and `\newpage` starts a new page.

Comment: @egreg: Thank you once again for helping me. You are a great person!!

Comment: Thank you for the kind comments. I will try to answer to the second question. The first line of your document starts a new paragraph. The line break happens at the place where you add `\par`. Then `\newpage` is executed. The line `\\` is just an empty line, so it breaks no paragraph and nothing else happens. The second page break is not needed because `\end{document}` ends a document.

Answer: I don't think I have understood your question but you can try this:

in your `main.tex` add after `\end{document}`:

\begin{code}
\par\newpage
\end{code}

in your `notes.tex` add before `\end{document}`

\begin{code}
\hfill\newpage
\end{code}

If your `notes.tex` file has `\end{document}` after `\hfill\newpage` then it will also work but you can't use it like `\end{document}` at the end of your `main.tex`.
