"She had a cerebrovascular 

accident with left sided weakness which has resolved in the past"
SOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  She does not smoke or drink
She lives with her family and her husband

times and makes eye contact"

motor in upper and lower extremities"

admitted on 03/22/70 by Dr"
She was in New York and experienced chest pain
She was seen at Conway Hospital where she underwent placement of two stents in the right coronary artery
"She was told that she would need further intervention, but comes with no paperwork"
She has had no further chest pain
She has been on Zocor
"Prior to recent coronary event, she underwent an echocardiogram which demonstrated a mildly thickened and calcific aortic valve with a slight gradient"
She has a Q-wave in III and F and slight reversal of R-wave progression in right precordium
"He is 73 years old, has history of diabetes starting in 2135, known history of peripheral artery disease with claudication and calf discomfort, for which he has previously seen Dr"
"Specifically, he describes having been evaluated by Dr"
"He received prior stenting to his right common iliac artery and his left superficial femoral artery, so far as I can tell"
"The stents were placed at Pomeroy Care Center (Big Rapids, AC) and also he had evaluation at the Corcoran District Hospital, and may have had a stenting procedure or revascularization procedure there"
"The patient and his wife are somewhat unclear about the dates and locations and times, but he does state that the treatments apparently did not help him at all"
"Currently, he has discomfort in both calves when he walks too far or too fast, and this stops him at about 50 yards"
"The issue was complicated by the fact that he has had progressive parkinsonian-type symptoms, walking in a shuffle, tipping forward, and occasionally even falling forward and losing his balance completely"
"His legs are rubbery, and he does even realize that he is falling forward when it happens"
It is worse when he is carrying things that weigh anything
"At the same time, his calves do cramp up in a typical fashion consistent with claudication, and he has known peripheral artery disease"
"Jeffers and Innis, and for which he was placed on Sinemet, presuming it was due to Parkinson's"
"Social history:

   He is retried Motor Vehicle Body Repairer"
He used to work at GM

He wears dentures
He denies chest discomfort or anything to suggest cardiac ischemia
He does not have any cogwheeling to my examination
"Currently, complains of symptoms that sound like claudication, predominantly involving the calves on both sides, right slightly ahead of the left, and I would not be surprised if he has significant focal obstructive disease along the length of his iliac of SFA"
"Since his ABIs are well preserved at rest, I suspect he does not have pre-occlusion of the SFA, for example"
"On the other hand, he does have diabetes and his ABIs may be falsely elevated"
"His major limitation is due to a combination of the claudication that occurs less than 50 yards and stops him at that point, and the gait disturbance that he has related to his movement disorder, possible Parkinson's disease"
"I am not sure that this latter entity has been well enough defined, and I would suggest that we have him see a neurologist here to better ascertain the nature of that disease, and as to whether there is anything better available in the way of treatment"
"Given that it has been a year or more since his last intervention, it is likely he will need another angiographic study (or MRA/CTA) in order to ascertain the nature of his disease"
He went to his PCP who as part of the workup did and ultrasound  and pt
"He denies S & S of cardiac ischemia, no h/o MI"

"I certainly do not think active surveillance is an option for him, which is a shame, as that was his preference"
"Left untreated, I think he will be in deep trouble at some stage over the next few years"
"On balance, my preference for him is either to have a radical prostatectomy, perhaps followed by postoperative radiation or alternatively, if he wishes to avoid surgery and he does, for him to have high-dose external radiation in conjunction with neoadjuvant and concomitant androgen deprivation"
While I think he will recover good voiding function after either of these treatment combinations his sex life is under threat and he is aware of this
We will defer the final decision next week until he has had his scans

He has not had any recurrent orthostatic symptoms since his Toprol dose was reduced last year
He has not had any exertionally related chest discomfort or symptoms similar to those prior to his percutaneous interventions
"On examination, he is comfortable at rest"

He will add hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily plus amlodipine 2
"A Holter monitor will also be placed in an attempt to determine what he is experiencing with the sense of ""fluttering"" which occurs at least nightly"
"He reports feeling better with systolic BP in the 120's on September 18, no further palpitations"
"He will continue to monitor BP and will call in to schedule ETT]

"If indeed we find components of obstructive lung disease or obstructive sleep apnea, we will have him see a pulmonologist and treat these accordingly"
I will see him again in six months' time

When she took off her pants there was no active bleeding from the wound and she denies any light-headedness or dizziness
There has been no further bleeding from the wound and she is otherwise without complaints
A CBC should be obtained in the ED to ensure that her hct is stable and she can then d/c home
She will follow up with Dr
Should the bleeding persist or return she should return to the ER or the clinic for a vascular U/S to assess for a pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula
The patient was in his otherwise good state of health when he went to his normal dialysis session yesterday

"Recommended her to start medications, she declines

I agree to Rx Ambien 5 mg QHS PRN # 30 and 6 refills

She will call the Psychiatric department at KEKELA to start therapy

Neck: supple no nodes; thyroid not enlarged, no nodules"
"If still high, I think he needs much more help getting in control"
"Since he sees nurse daily, will have to ask for her to check sugars, adjust meds after"
A lot has happened since I last saw him in 10/2119
He is status post bilateral carotid endarterectomies and also has known vertebral disease with a history of a left occipital stroke
He subsequently was referred to Dr
In November 1 morning after going to the bathroom he developed sudden onset of vertigo
He continued to have positional vertigo in the emergency room such that if he sat up he would become very vertiginous and off balance but if he laid with his eyes closed
He felt better
"He was found to be orthostatic and his symptoms improved according to the chart by the next day though according to the patient, it took a couple of days for his symptoms to improve significantly"
Although he significantly improved he still feels &#34;a little off balance&#34;
He is fine when he is sitting but he notes when he stands up he just &#34;feels off&#34;
He does not feel acutely vertiginous and does not have any sense of movement but does not feel as steady as he used to on his feet
He has seen Guy in physical therapy and is working on balance therapy
He subsequently did undergo left ICA stent placement on 12/22/2119 without any complication
"Also of note, I neglected to mention above, that when he became acutely vertiginous in November there were no other accompanying symptoms"
He was discharged after his left carotid endarterectomy on Plavix as well as aspirin that he had been on prior to his admission
He also was switched while in the hospital from hydrochlorothiazide to Inderal for blood pressure control although he was orthostatic sitting up
Lying down he was hypertensive
He has had no new neurologic symptoms since his discharge from NDMG after his carotid endarterectomy on 12/22/2119
The left he is status post left knee fusion

Chief  Complaint:  ""dizzy, slurred speech"" 		

History of Present Illness:  65 year old RH gentleman with Hx notable for HTN and CASHD, was working on taxes and making barbecued chicken this afternoon, when at 1am he had the sudden onset of feeling ""dizzy, disoriented"" and having ""slurred speech"""
"He reports that he ""couldn't remember what I was trying to say"", and that his words both sounded ""like [I] was drunk"""
"He also stated that at times, when he would try to talk, nothing would come out"
"He walked downstairs, with difficulty, and his wife noticed that in the hallway he was bumping into items on (falling to) his right"
"She underwent evaluation with MR stress test which revealed inferior
ischemia"
"Patient was in her usual state of health until 3 days prior to admission, when she began experiencing unremitting substernal chest pain, nonradiating"
Upon their arrival at her house she was given 2 doses of SL nitro which improved her pain
She was admitted for continued rule out for MI and workup of her pulmonary findings
"Hx TB-patient says she was diagnosed at age 19, received drug therapy and spent time in a sanatorium"
"This constellation of symptoms may be viewed in several different ways:  from a cardiac standpoint, as presentation of unstable angina, given her hx of MI and cardiac risk factors; from an oncological standpoint, as a pheochromocytoma or carcinoid syndrome, given the sympathomimetic nature of her symptoms such as dizziness, abd pain/nausea, chest pain and dyspnea, and the findings in Ab CT and Chest CT, or a primary lung cancer given her history of smoking; from an infectious disease standpoint, as possible reactivation tuberculosis, given that she has a history of TB infection and treatment"
"I believe the priority of the differential should be granted to the oncologic and infectious etiologies, given that she appears to be ruling out for an MI, has little to no ischemic changes on EKG, and is chest pain free with continued exacerbation of her shortness of breath and sweating"
He has a long history of coronary artery disease and this includes angioplasty and coronary artery bypass grafting in 2065
"The pain did not radiate up to his neck or arm, but when the pain persisted even after returning from Blountstown, he went to Roper Hospital North two days ago because of his chest discomfort to see his cardiologist"
"He was admitted to the hospital, had a cardiac catheterization, which according to the patient did not show any specific lesion"
"The doctors felt that he did not have a myocardial infarction, but that in fact his abnormality was due to a chest wall/muscular type syndrome"
"He was discharged on anti-inflammatory medicine and the patient had noted that when he took the aspirin over the past month, his discomfort was improved"
"The patient states that he had the chest x-rays at the hospital and in fact also had a CT scan, which did not show any pulmonary embolism"
The patient denies specifically any flank pain or any bleeding and he has no recent weight loss
I spoke to the patient at length about this matter and he will consult with Dr
"The patient remains on his usual medicines and according to him, his hemoglobin A1c and blood sugars have remained fairly satisfactory"
"The patient does not use his mask and I cautioned him to get back using that, as this may have an effect on his coronary artery disease"
The patient was noted in the hospital to have elevated blood pressures despite his medicine and he was asked to increase his Norvasc from 5 mg to 10 mg per day
"He denies any trouble with his ears, nose or throat"
He has no chronic cough or coughing blood
"He denies any nausea, vomiting, black or bloody stool"
He has no burning on urination
"The chest did show a healed coronary artery bypass graft scar, but he did have chest wall discomfort to palpation in the costochondral area on the left"
"Renal function to be rechecked secondary to his CT scanning and history of diabetes with Glucophage, which he has restarted"
Will follow up with the patient by phone tomorrow regarding his lab tests and also he will consult with Dr
"History of present illness   Doing well- no complains of dyspnea unless he is ""doing a lot"
He wakes up at night several times with nocturia or restlessness
"Lately he has not been adherent to diet (ice cream, cake, etc)"

She was still complaining of slightly dizziness and low back discomfort
The skin is warm and dry and she looks quite calm
She is fully alert
"The dizziness and low back discomfort that she describes could possibly be associated with a drop in blood pressure to 170 mmHg, with mild hypoperfusion of her spinal arteries, as well as her head"
"However, today she had dizziness even with a blood pressure of 160 mmHg"
"Though we could be tempted to juggle with her regimen and reduce her amlodipine slightly, or change the times when she takes the medications, I think that we are facing some difficulties only related to the poor autoregulation of her cerebral and peripheral vessels"

regimen as prescribed by Dr"
"Immediately after his discharge from CCGH after his hospitalization, he went
directly to West Virginia where his wife was able to care for him"
"He had one episode of CHF, which
was managed as an outpatient, and he is now on slightly doses of Lasix than previously"

present time, he has no active symptoms of CHF, he continues to sleep on two large pillows at
night without symptoms of orthopnea and has minimal to no peripheral edema"
"He does
continue on an ACE inhibitor and potassium along with his Lasix"
"Despite all of his active issues, he has no current symptoms of
angina and has tolerated his multiple recent procedures well"

range"

to re-establish baseline"
"ADDENDUM:  In reviewing patient's medical records after he left today, I found mention of
both hematuria and guaiac positive stool during his recent hospitalizations"
"At this time, he was
quite debilitated and I do not think it would be a good time for colonoscopy"
"He did deny
abdominal symptoms as part of my review of systems today"
"At this point, my plan will be to send him some stool guaiac cards which he can do at home and
send in to me by mail"
"If he has persistent hematuria or guaiac positive stool, then we will need to discuss
more aggressive work-up, but given his overall health condition, I do not feel the need to be
aggressive at this time and would like to see him get some strength back first"
he says his diet has been reasonable with a few exceptions when he has cheated and his blood sugar did reflect what he ate
I believe it`s time to change him to Lantus for better coverage
P I will change his NPH to Lantus 10units at bedtime he will continue testing at least twice a day and he says he is going to test at least 4x`s a day for a while
he is still on glucotrol which we may need to discontinue as not to increase his hypoglcemic episodes
I will mail him scripts to fill at his request and call him to review blood sugars and need for titration in about 2 weeks to give him enough time to be on the insulin for at least 1 week
"In general, he has been failing at home, unable to care for himself, and requiring increasing VNA"

He recently gave his indoor cat away as he hypothesized that she had something to do with his cough/MDS
He does not recall tick bites and has infrequently visited Storting and Capitol
"Clinically he is unchanged over many months, so empiric antibiotics would not be indicated"
"He is a 71-year-old, right-handed man who was admitted to the Sutton Family Care on December 29, 2088 with left arm weakness, ataxia and dysarthria"
"The following day, he had a flaccid hemiparesis of the left side"
"He had an embolic workup which consisted of an echocardiogram showing a preserved ejection fraction, dilated left atrium, very mild inferior hypokinesis, and no patent foramen ovale"
He had a Holter monitor which did not reveal any dysrhythmias
He did not have any evidence of a flow limiting MCA stenosis
"He had been on aspirin prior, Plavix was added to his regimen"

"He has had no further episodes of weakness, numbness, tingling, ataxia, dysarthria, or dysphagia"

"Unfortunately, his left arm has remained flaccid and he has no movement"
I told him that his left arm will most likely remain with severe weakness
I believe he has been on Gemfibrozil for a while
"However, since he has been on this medicine so long, it may be worthwhile to continue using it if it is controlling his total cholesterol well"
He should continue on an aspirin a day
He states that he is having difficulty obtaining Plavix due to the cost
"I recommended to him that, in the experience of the Stroke Service at Sutton Family Care, patients in his situation do benefit from being on Plavix for a period of time after a stroke of this type"
We recommended to him that he continue on Plavix for another six months because of this
"After six months, if he has had no further clinical events, it would be reasonable to assume that his atheroma is stable and that he could be adequately treated with aspirin"
I will see him again in clinic in approximately six months
"I have

discussed the management with him"

He says that he could no longer feel a palpable graft pulse as he could just after the surgery
"He has been

"He denies
fever and his blood glucose levels have started to improve a
little bit"
He has an appointment in Vascular Surgery in two days
"I have
asked him that it is extremely important for him to keep that
appointment for the evaluation of this ulceration and his
vascular status"
"I have also reviewed with him that he may need
to be hospitalized if a vascular procedure is recommended"
"Unfortunately, he does not have an appointment with Podiatry
until the end of this month"
"ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  He will be seen by me again in a few days
after he is seen in Vascular Surgery"
"In the meantime, he will
continue with all his medications"
"I have given him a
prescription for Zocor 20 mg q"
"since the pharmacy could not
give him Lipitor that I had prescribed"
He is on no ACE inhibitor
He is not currently treated
"However, he should be on an ACE inhibitor"
"Started Keflex

at home because he had some and took for 2 days"
"She showed me a foot ulcer

that she has had since early August"
She was treated with Augmentin for 2 weeks with little improvement
"She has not

had any fever"
She continues on her chronic pain medications and Percocet
"Drew

take a look at her foot who agreed that she should be seen in the emergency room"
"She also was given a

new prescription for her Percocet #100"
"It appears that she had been having a several-month history of anginal-type symptoms, although a stress test obtained in March showed no significant ischemia"
"On 04/09/2076 she was in New York helping a family member with start up of a restaurant, when she woke up in the morning with a sudden onset of chest discomfort and lightheadedness, and according to her daughter suffered a cardiac arrest"
She was taken emergently to Cabrini Medical Center where she was found to have an inferior wall myocardial infarction and underwent coronary stenting
I do not have records from this admission that she does have her stent cards that indicate that she received a 3
"Per her daughter's report, she had a significant lesion in another blood vessel, which was felt to require percutaneous coronary intervention"
"Since her myocardial infarction, she actually has felt quite well"
She no longer has the angina that she had prior to her MI
Her major complaints are that she occasionally feels lightheaded and somewhat fatigued but overall feels well
She is able to walk normal distances without cardiac symptoms
She has no known drug allergies

She has normal left ventricular function with a mild intracavitary gradient of 9 mmHg
She has mild aortic sclerosis with a velocity across the aortic valve of 2
She has only mild mitral regurgitation
She did receive drug-eluting stents
The good news is that appears that her left ventricular function is very well preserved suggesting that she did not have a large myocardial infarction
"What is less clear, however, is the status of her other coronaries, there is some suggestion that she may have significant coronary artery disease at this time"
"From a clinical standpoint, I certainly do not think that she requires a cardiac catheterization at this time"
"She is fairly asymptomatic, and is doing well from the cardiovascular standpoint"
I think what would be more helpful in guiding recommendation is whether she has significant underlying ischemia at this point
"In terms of her lipids, it appears that she has been switched to Lipitor"
"In terms of antithrombotic therapy, she did receive drug-eluting stents"
"Therefore, she should certainly remain on aspirin for the remainder of her life and Plavix for an absolute minimum of one year"
"She is on a very good medical regimen, although I think she would benefit from a beta-blocker"
She tried it during the day but too sleepy
She has had persistent chest pain and sob since Father's dealth
She tried SLNTG without improvement
Rivers started glucophage 825 BID but she doesn't take it all the time
She admits to not taking her lipitor - worrries it had some effect on her vision
She is worried she will always have DM
She will continue to monitor home FSBS
She wants to rediscuss at end of year

Chief Complaint	

Mrs Chapman  is here to follow up on Back pain, HTN, S/P TAH and DM



History of Present Illness	

For the past 21 days has had  back pain since she was involved in a low speed MVA"
She developed LBP and has had it since
The next day she had the TAH
"Hasn been taking Tylenol PRN with no relif



She has a TAH and BSO on 9/2/83 for a pelvic mass, found to be serous cystadenoma"
"Feeling well, occasional wound discomfort,  she was not aware of her uterus being removed"
"S/P TAH BSO

Explained to her the procedure and she understood"
"The patient states that this PM he had an 
episode where he experienced nausea, dizziness and weakness"
"He 
also states that he developed left sided substernal chest pressure 
which was non-radiating"
"He states that he took one sublingual 
nitroglycerin with relief of his discomfort"
"He states that after 
about 10 minutes he had a brief syncopal episode lasting 20-30 
seconds"
"He states that it was witnessed by his wife and it was 
non-observed seizure activity, incontinence, or post ictal 
confusion"
"He states that the episode occurred while he was 
walking to the bathroom"
"He does remember falling to the floor, 
but denies any trauma"
"He specifically denies any headache, neck 
pain, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, or focal 
numbness or weakness"
"He was 
subsequently transferred to Jellico Community Hospital Emergency 
Department for further evaluation and management"
ALLERGIES:  He has a known drug allergy to zocor
"He denies 
alcohol use"
"However, BP was reportedly as high as 190/106 (and wife says she&#8217;s measured it this high at home at least once in past 2 weeks), and blood glucose 400s"
"I see no LMR note about the visit, but am told that he was given some medication for his BP, given some insulin and a Rx for insulin, and instructed to see his PCP the next day, and discharged"
"Friday he did see his PCP, who told him not to take insulin but to take oral DM meds instead, and told him to return to the ED b/c he still had a terrible HA, so he came back to the EDUCARE-PULLMAN ED tonight"
"He was given caffeine, ibuprofen, Tylenol, and compazine, reported that his HA was gone"
"An MRI was originally ordered, but canceled when it came to notice that he has an implanted device to prevent syncope that precludes MRI"
"He is very unpleasant and un-forthcoming about his history, slow to cooperate w/ exam; says he wants to go home, resents being in the ED still now that his HA is gone"
"MEDS: metoprolol, omeprazole, simvastatin (he is unsure whether this is all)

ALL: nkda

PMH: 

-HTN; he denies prior dx of DM before yesterday night

-recurrent cardiogenic syncope, for which he has had &#8220;Reveal&#8221; device implanted, then explanted b/c of pain, then recurrent sycope and reimplantation of device, after which syncope stopped (see notes in LMR from Dr"
"Neurology was specifically consulted for his gait, which does appear a bit wide-based, but he and wife confirm that this is chronic, and I strongly doubt any relation to his current HA problems"
"Most obvious medical issues to focus on here are his poorly controlled HTN, which I suspect is the primary cause of his HA, and his uncontrolled DM, of which he obviously does not yet understand the import and does not seem likely to comply with insulin treatment without further education"
"Keith Gilbert, MD, PhD, 

Neurology resident PGY3



Addendum: 

He did not mention this when I questioned him and wife about PMH, but digging through prior LMR notes I find this addition to his PMH: 

A note from Dr"
"Robert Irish, neurosurgery, from 3/2099 notes that he is s/p &#8220;cervical laminectomy and foramen magnum resection followed by removal of an intramedullary tumor near his foramen magnum"
He is doing much better today
"He states that his headaches are considerably better, and the left hemibody dysesthesias are much better tolerated since the initiation of Neurontin"

Follow Up - post hospitalization visit



He was admitted 2/01-2/03/74 for NSTEMI"
"On 1/31 he had symptoms similar to those he experienced prior to his MI in 2073: pain in back of left neck, left shoulder, and left arm"
As a result he did not exercise that day
"On 2/01 he did his normal exercise routine, running on the treadmill for 40 minutes; he felt fine"
"Later that day, he had recurrence of the symptoms so he called Dr"
Patterson was covering and recommended he go to ED
He is very impressed that Dr
Patterson saw him that evening in the ED
He was admitted to cardiology service and managed with integrullin and heparin
"When second set of enzymes was positive on 2/02 he went to cath lab, where old RCA stent was ""pristine,"" LAD showed stable 50% lesion, but distal LCx showed 90% lesion"
"He had PTCA and stenting with medicated stent, producing excellent result"
He was discharged on 2/03 on plavix
"Today, he says he has had no recurrence of symptoms"
He is feeling great
He is concerned that he had the MI despite taking all his medications as prescribed and feeling so well with exercise
He wonders whether he needs to re-start cardiac rehab
He is avoiding exercise until he sees Dr
He has had no groin hematoma or other complications
"May need increase in atenolol to bid to avoid plaque rupture in future; now on plavix (gave him some samples b/c of cost), will continue x 6 months; he will avoid exercising for now and discuss cardiac rehab with Dr"
"Current illness began 5-6 months ago with fatigue, dyspnea on exertion that has progressed to the point that she has to stop to catch her breath after walking up only 4-5 steps in a stairwell"

The murmur intensifies when she stands
"She is obviously older than typical presentation of sarcoidosis, but she had previous lymphadenopathy that may have been a first presentation of the illness with spontaneous remission"
She should not receive diuretics at present
"I think she will need corticosteroids for her sarcoidosis and I expect this will improve the hypercalcemia, but we need definitive diagnosis first"
"May need rates in the 150-200 range to control her hypercalcemia acutely, but she has had this for some time, so can be conservative with fluids approach"

MRN:      4097229



Last week he had a right carotid endarterectomy"
"Initially, he had some hoarseness"
He did have a period of 100
He is still hoarse today
He feels a little achy in the joints
"1 F



On exam, he is hoarse"
"I elected to go ahead and treat

     him with doxycycline 100 mg b"
"He does have

     follow-up with his neurosurgeon in the next 10 days or so"
He recovered well and was discharged on an appropriate medical program (see below)
He had an outpatient ETT-MIBI to further evaluate the significance of the residual LCx disease
"He had this on 12/07/34 and he exercised for 6 minutes, 7 METS and achieved a heart rate 70% of predicted"
"He did not experience chest pain, had an appropriate increase in systolic blood pressure and the study was terminated due to leg fatigue"
He had a recurrent episode of chest pain (somewhat different than his MI as it was not pressure like) and presented to the ED in March
"His ECG was stable and biomarkers were negative and he had a repeat ETT-MIBI in which he exercised for 7 mins 10 sec, achieving 9 METS, 80% MPHR, peak double product 19K"
He has overall done well since the time of his STEMI
He completed part of the program at cardiac rehab
"He quit cigarette smoking at the time of the MI, and has remained abstinent since then"
He resumed normal activities without limiting symptoms in terms of chest pain or shortness of breath
Three days ago he reports the onset of chest pain
Not related to exertion and he has not tried SL TNG
"He states that he has been carrying heavy holiday packages and did some light outdoor work, and wonders if the pain may have been caused by those activities (i"
"He has 2 flights of stairs at home and is able to climb them with minimal shortness of breath, which has not changed since the onset of the CP"
"He is unsure how the character relates to that of his previous MI, and he thinks it is similar to the discomfort he had in March that prompted his ED visit and negative stress test"
He denies lightheadedness or syncope
He continues to be compliant with his medical regimen
He had a past sleep study which indicates the presence of sleep disordered breathing and he states he is in the process of acquiring home CPAP therapy
He does report weight gain since stopping cigarettes
"Assessment and plan:
   60 year old man with CAD status post inferior STEMI 11/34 treated with 3 bare metal stents to the RCA territory, Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia, and Ankylosing spondylitis who is overall doing well with secondary prevention efforts for his coronary disease, although he does report a chest pain syndrome for the past several days"
"1) Coronary artery disease: Bare metal stents only are in place in the RCA territory, and he has now completed over a 12 month course of Plavix therapy"
"Motrin), he will stop Plavix to help minimize the bleeding risk and since there is no absolute indication for him to continue it at this point"
"He will continue the medical regimen of ASA 81mg daily, Lipitor 20mg daily, Toprol XL 25mg daily and Lisinopril 10mg daily"
The chest pain syndrome that he has been having for the past several days is reassuring in the sense that it is not exertion related and it seems similar to March when he had an ETT-MIBI without ischemia on perfusion images
"He does have a known 70% stenosis in a non-dominant LCx, but two imaging studies have not shown ischemia in that territory"
"I will call the patient in several days time, and if he continues to have symptoms he can have a repeat ETT"
He can start with 500 mg qhs for the first 2-3 weeks to help get through the common adverse effects (i
He should take the medication with a glass of cold water and may take his daily aspirin 30 minutes before to help minimize side effects
"After a few weeks, he can increase to the maintenance dose of 1000 mg qhs"
He has quit smoking completely since the time of the MI and plans to continue this forward
He was encouraged to increase his physical activity level
He will be starting CPAP for sleep apnea soon which may have a favorable effect on his blood pressure

"He immediately felt lightheaded, disoriented, nauseous, generally weak, and as though he was about to faint"
"He was able to walk a few steps, sit down, and rest for 15-20min before he realized his symptoms weren't resolving, called his sister, and put his head on the table and felt he could not really move because he was so weak"

"He felt some heat from his car, 
thought that it was overheating, and then developed some chest pain 
and throat tightness"
"He really described what seems to be 
fleeting chest tightness and no diaphoresis, no shortness of 
breath, and no arm numbness or tingling"
"However, he did have one 
associated symptom of some throat tightness"
"He had an echocardiogram at that time that 
was also normal"
"He was seen at Southwest Texas Medical Center and 
then sent here appearing somewhat anxious, with a normal physical 
examination, normal EKG, normal chest x-ray, and normal metabolic

Will transition him to insuline with 25 units NPH sc qhs and he will monitor sugars bid and report back to me
"Due to recent DVT and his being on coumadin, he would not be amenable to undergo prostate biopsy in the next few weeks"
"If PSA remains high, will have him see urology"
"After being discharged
from our service he was
readmitted to the Medical
Service with a severe

Qazi"
"Patient did agree that she has been watching
what she eats because she did not want to gain much weight"
Asked if she can use an OTC pain patch called Salonpas
"Says that the chest wall
tenderness is very different from any exertional chest pain that she may have had in
the past"
"The patient reports that since she awoke in the AM on 12/07/94, she noticed that her RUE and RLE was weak and numb"
"She apparently had come to the ED about 2 days ago for RLE numbness and pain which has been worsening over the past 1-2 months, but reportedly had good strength on neurological exam, and she was not admitted"
She was given  a 2-day course of Levaquin for UTI
"She states that despite the pain in the RLE 2 days ago, she was able to move her RLE whereas since yesterday she has not been able to move it as easily or bear weight"

"Since this morning, she has had nausea and vomiting as well (did not have this yesterday), and has not had any fevers or chest pain"
She has had SOB today
"She reports having frequent BLE spasms, usually at night, and her legs become quite restless"
She has had numbness/tingling and shooting pain in the RLE for the past 1-2 months likely due  to disease in the lumbar spine seen on MRI (L5-S1)
"She states that the current weakness in the RLE is new, as is the weakness in the RUE"
"Additionally, she has new nausea/vomiting and SOB since this AM"
"While in the ED, following her CT scans, she was tachycardic to the 150s and hypertensive to the 230s systolic"

to see Dr"
"As you know, she is a 64 year old woman with hypertension,

hyperlipidemia and a positive family history of coronary disease"
"She noticed a nodule in her neck in April or May of this year and

brought it to the attention of her doctors and given that it has

increased in size, it is felt to be a potential malignancy and

she is currently scheduled to undergo thyroidectomy in September

of this year"
"In terms of her cardiac history, she was well

until four years ago when she developed acute shortness of breath

and was admitted to Lake Park Hospital for congestive heart

failure"
"At that time, she had an exercise Thallium scan which

revealed a low work load at only 3 minutes stopping secondary to

shortness of breath with a large fixed anterolateral defect and a

dilated left ventricle"
"In addition, she had an echo in June of

2071, which shows an ejection fraction of 25% with 1+ mitral

regurgitation, left atrial enlargement and diastolic dysfunction"
"She has never been hospitalized since that time for her

congestive heart failure and has been treated medically with good

result"
"She currently denies any orthopnea, PND, angina or

claudication"

Issue number one,  preoperative cardiovascular risk assessment: 

given that she has not had an assessment of her ischemic burden

since 2067, I have scheduled her for a repeat exercise test with

imaging"
"If this is similar to her previous study showing only

fixed defects and no reversible ischemia, then I feel that she

will be of low to moderate risk for surgery for perioperative

myocardial infarction and that her congestive heart failure is

well treated and therefore, will not preclude her from having

surgery"
"She is currently on Coumadin for low ejection

fraction"
"As far as I know, she has never had atrial fibrillation

and she has never been told that she had an irregular rate or

rhythm"
"Therefore, I recommend that she stop her Coumadin 6 days

prior to surgery and it can be restarted several days after

surgery without Heparin overlap at the discretion of the surgeons

as to how may days she should wait after surgery before

restarting that medication"
"She will otherwise remain on her

current medical regimen as determined by her cardiologist and

primary care physician, Dr"
"If her stress test

is without reversible defects, she need not follow up with me for

further evaluation"
"She was seen

and examined with Dr"
"She has acknowledged difficulty following her regimen, per notes should be taking insulin BID but only takes it in am - prescribed dose NPH 30 in am and 8 at HS"
"She is s/p L SFA and doing well from that standopoint, however developed N&V today and required NG tube placement, now better but remaoins NPO"
She has been on NPH 30 in am and BG's have been 126- low 200's
"No recent symptoms of angina though he apparently was started on
Imdur during a hospitalization in West Virginia this spring"
"He has
frequent ectopics versus"
"He had an episode of shortness of breath leading
to hospitalization this spring down in West Virginia"
"He has had two pillow
orthopnea and worsening edema than in the past"
"He has also
noted some more exertional dyspnea"
"He denies cough, wheeze,
hemoptysis"
"He is currently on a regimen of Imdur, Lasix,
Carvedilol, Zestril and Digoxin"
"Weight is actually down 10 pounds
which he attributes to excellent attention to diet"
"He continues to receive routine dental and
podiatry care"
"He
continues on Coumadin"
"He has not tolerated Niacin in
the past"
"He is status post left TKR
by Dr"
He was seen by Dr
"Robles who treated him briefly with
Vioxx but this caused significant worsening lower extremity edema
and decreased urine output requiring its discontinuation"
"He is
now carefully using ibuprofen and has follow up scheduled with
Dr"
As you know she is a 72 year-old woman with prior stroke
She has a prolonged hospital course as well as rehab stay and now returns having made significant recovery
She is here with her family who is translating
"She ambulates with walker, but does well over short distances without it"
She communicates well with eth family and is able to feed and dress herself
She has an aid for bathing three ties per week
She has not needed the PEG tube in the past 6 months and is eager to have it removed
"She has not had any new episodes of weakness, numbness, visual or language changes"
She has a very supportive family
She has a mild right HP
She has had a significant recovery
"Given that her bleed was a SDH and in the setting of elevated INR, it is worth considering restarting warfarin,  until then, she should at least be on ASA and I have communicated this with them"
She should continue with her BP and cholesterol treatment as well
She is eager to remove the PEG and I will refer her to Dr Queen for this

Dear Harry and Yair:



My thanks for your kind referral of the above noted patient with respect to her disabling claudication and of course she is not in a very happy circumstance"
"As you know, she is just 52 years of age"
"Her cardiovascular risk factors include type 2 diabetes treated with metformin and Glyburide, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and she is a former cigarette smoker but she has not smoked in a year"
She spends a lot of time caring for her partially disabled husband
She has known and impressive history of peripheral vascular disease
She has undergone bilateral leg revascularizations
On the left side initially an iliac stent was tried but in January of 2063 she had a left iliofemoral endarterectomy with angioplasty and in situ above knee left fem-pop bypass graft
"This reconstruction is functioning well, as evidenced by pulse examination and she certainly does not have any major symptoms in the left side"
In April of 2063 she had a right common femoral and external iliac endarterectomy with a right fem-pop bypass graft to the above-knee popliteal artery using transposed greater saphenous veins
She states that the procedure in the right leg was only transiently of benefit
a year ago she again had rather limiting claudication
She says this is now worse over the past several months and she quantifies this as severe calf pain after just a couple of blocks
Importantly she does not have ischemic rest pain and she has never had tissue loss
length thereof - she did not bring the films themselves) and a patent albeit small reconstituted above-knee popliteal artery with decent runoff
She has sought an opinion here in this regard
She has no known coronary artery disease and her general system review is notable for a prior hospitalization in 2061 for severe pancreatitis requiring laparotomy
"She has femoral pulses on both sides and the left fem-pop bypass graft in situ is palpable, as is the left popliteal pulse"
She does have dependent rubor on that right side although there is no tissue breakdown
"Her risk factor control is decent and she should certainly stay on the Lipitor, aspirin and Plavix"
Since her problem is claudication I would like Yair to institute Pletal at full dosages and give this at least a couple of months before we can say that she has had an adequate trial with question benefit
She will get the actual arteriogram from the October study to me
Pt reports that she had dinner last night about 6pm and had her last BM at 10pm (also last flatus)
She began to experience N/V at about 11pm and had several episodes of NBNB emesis
"She denies any diarrhea, blood in her stools, no dysuria"
She has not experienced any fevers
He has never used nitroglycerin
"He
       has gone through the cardiac rehab program"
Review of systems:  He does have sleep apnea on CPAP
"Urinalysis today showed greater than 100 red blood cells and he said this was
  due to penile trauma from tight shorts"
He did see blood that day
He has never seen it since
He has multiple seborrheic keratoses including on his penis
He will see Field Crest Care Center
"During the day yesterday, he went on his daily walk with his wife and felt fine"
"In the evening around 8:30 pm, he experienced dull, 8/10 pain under both arm pits which resolved within 20 minutes after taking 3 SL TNG 5 mins apart"
"He denies SOB, N/V, radiation or diaphoresis associated with this arm pain"
He states that he gets similar bilateral underarm pain about twice per week which is usually relieved by a single SL TNG within 10-15 mins
"After the arm pain relieved last night, the pt took 3 Aleve tabs which his daughter bought for him for arthritis pain"
"A couple of hours later, he became nauseated and had a single episode of    dark brown    emesis"
"After vomiting, he felt light-headed while walking around the house"
"He had a bowel movement this AM which he states was darker than usual, almost black looking"
"He denies BRBPR, abdominal pain, CP, SOB, palpitations, headache, fever or chills"
He was noted to be in A fib
"However, he did have another episode of bilateral arm pain which was relieved by SL TNG x 3"
He subsequently received lopressor 2
She had an extensive workup in which it was unclear whether these represented a transient ischemic attack or partial seizures
She was started on Depakote for this
In July 2102 she had several episodes of loss of consciousness which ultimately were diagnosed as syncope
"Yandell   s family describes her syncopal events differently, stating that she will stare into space for 5-8 minutes, during which time she is unresponsive"
"When she    wakes up,    she is confused and sleepy for ~ 20 minutes and will often have nausea and vomiting"
"Yandell does state that she feels    dizzy and lightheaded    before these events, and reports that her family says she looks pale and clammy"
She does not recall the events herself
"She received zofran for nausea, ASA, and IVF, and was transferred up to the floor for further management"
The patient denies that the episodes occur after she rises from a sitting position
"Do not occur when    bearing down,    or when she is exerting herself"
The episodes are not sudden     she appears to have some warning before one occurs
She denies fevers/chills
"She takes antihypertensive medications, but takes them as directed and by report does not group them together"
