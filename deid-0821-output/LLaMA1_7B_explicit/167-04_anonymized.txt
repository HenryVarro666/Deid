DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES:

EKG: A-fib, T-wave flattening in I, II, III, no ST-segment changes.
-----------------------------------



ASSESSMENT:  66 yo woman h/o chronic pancreatitis, CAD, hyperlipidemia here with likely acute on chronic pancreatitis.


PLAN:


GI - Pancreatitis.  Pt's abd pain c/w previous episodes of pancreatitis, lipase moderately elevated (never has been extremely elevated), leukocytosis.  Ddx includes cardiac chest pain, hepatitis, PNA, AAA, aortic dissection, colitis, enteritis, peptic ulcer dz.  Pt's EKG not concerning for MI, liver enzymes are WNL, has no respiratory sx, has no diarrhea, and is hemodynamically stable.
  Pancreatitis is therefore most likely.
-- NPO
-- Hydrate with NS. Rec'd 1L NS in the ED, does not appear volume-down.  Will give another 1L bolus, fluids at 125/h
-- Etiology for pancreatits unclear.  Contact her gastroenterologist, Dr. Bert Lord, to notify of this admission and to get previous records
-- manage pain w/ Dilaudid - 1mg IV effective in ED.


CV. Pt w/ h/o HTN, CAD, paroxysmal a-fib.
-- continue warfarin 2mg qhs except Saturday, 1mg qhs on Saturday
-- check INR to ensure pt therapeutic on warfarin
-- continue nadolol
-- continue spironolactone
-- hold verapamil sustained release, start verapamil 60 mg q8h b/c BP a bit low
-- substitute for Lipitor 20mg qhs per hospital formulary


Renal. Pt's creatinine has been trending up over the last year, ? possible chronic renal failure.  Also possibilty of mild ARF in setting of dehydration.
-- check UA
-- f/u as outpt


Endocrine. Pt w/ DM on metformin.
-- send Hgb A1c
-- cover with SSI while inpt


Neuro.
-- continue gabapentin


Psych. 
-- continue amitriptyline 10 mg qhs


FEN. 
-- NPO
-- hydrate as above


DVT prophylaxis. 

-- dalteparin 5000u SQ qday
