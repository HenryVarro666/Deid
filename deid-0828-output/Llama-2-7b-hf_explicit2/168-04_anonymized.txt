ID/CC: 55 yo male presents from rehab facility with shaking activity.



HPI:	 He has a h/o frozen shoulder and is s/p left shoulder arthroscopy, capsular release,

09/03/2073. He was discharged on OxyContin 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. x4 days, oxycodone 5-10 mg

p.o. q.3h. p.r.n. pain. He returned to the SMH ED on Mon 9/17 with shaking activity that was episodic but not rhythmic. He was given Narcan and the shaking subsided. He was sent back to rehab off opiates. He returns today from the rehab facility with recurrence of shaking activity

He was given Ativan 1mg at rehab today. 

In the ED he was given Ativan 2mg, Haldol 5mg, Narcan 0.4 mg (after which he was more awake) and Lopressor 5 mg iv

     This assay is very sensitive to morphine and codeine. The assay is less

     sensitive to oxycodone. Large quantities of oxymorphone and/or meperidine

     can also cause positive results.
