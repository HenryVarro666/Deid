Comment: This looks really interesting! I don't have any specific comments yet, but I'd like to ask a few questions for clarification. First off, what kind of data is being used to train these models? Secondly, how does it compare to human annotaters?

Comment: Thank you very much for your interest in this work.  In my experience, the model is better than a human annotator but that's not saying much.  It's better than a human annotator but still needs a human review.  The data being used to train the model is the entirety of the medical records that are available, but only the first 2121 of them are used.  The model is trained to predict the next 513 characters (or less) and this is a fairly common problem.  If you are curious about the actual dataset, I can post it.

Answer: This is interesting. I have not seen this paper, and I'm not sure I can get to it in the time I have before I have to go to work.

It seems like this paper would be a good test for whether I have a good intuition of what constitutes good writing style. I've been thinking about this problem a good bit lately.

I'm guessing that you will be getting a lot of different types of text, and that they will be all different length, and will all vary greatly as far as style, structure, grammar, and vocabulary.

I think it would be really helpful if you could get a lot of different samples of text, that are representative of the types of things you will be working with.

You could use the [CNN/DailyMail dataset](http://cse.unl.edu/nltk/data/imagenet/dailymail/) as an interesting example of a dataset, or you should be able to find some other datasets online, like this [one from UCSD](http://nlp.cs.sdsu.edu/data/web2/).

It seems like this would be the first thing you should be doing.  It's hard to know what to look for, unless you get a lot of examples from the real data.

You will also need to think about what the features are that you want to measure.  I'm assuming that you know that you want to measure readability.  You need to figure out how you're going to measure readability.

You probably want to use [the Flesch-Kincaid readability formula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readability_formulas) to measure readability.  The Flesch readability formula is not perfect, but it's a good enough first step to get something working.

The [Flesch Score](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch_readability_score) is a measure of how many years of formal education are required to understand a piece of text on average.

It's also good if you can make the model understand some other pieces of information about the text.

For example, you might want to be able to tell how long the text is, and whether it's a paragraph, a list, a sentence, and so on.

This could be very difficult, and you'll probably need to do some sort of statistical analysis to get at the data you need.

For example, if the data comes in paragraphs, then the first and last paragraphs are probably not going to be very good, but the middle ones are going to be very useful.

If you want it to learn the different sentence lengths, you're probably going to need to count how many words are in all of the sentences.  You could also probably do something similar with lists and with bullet points, for example.

There's also probably a way to count the number of commas in a text (this is a good measure, since it's related to the word count, and it will probably correlate well to the number of words).  There are probably a lot more things like this you can do with your machine learning model.

You could probably use the model to predict the number of words in the sentence, but the problem with that is that a lot of text contains no words, but the number of words and the sentence is a list of 3rd line of text, but the sentence is a list of text, but the sentence is a list of text, but the sentence is a list of text, but the date
