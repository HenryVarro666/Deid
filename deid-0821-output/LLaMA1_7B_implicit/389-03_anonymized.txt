Attending: Frank Ash

Chief Complaint: shortness of breath

History of Present Illness: Mr. Pearson is a an 87 year old gentleman with COPD on home oxygen, CVA, DM, and history of lung cancer s/p resection without chemotherapy who presented to the ED with acute shortness of breath.  Of note, he was hospitalized from May 26 until May 29 for a COPD flare, and was discharged home at that time on a prednisone taper, which he completed about one week ago.  He was in his usual state of good health and had even spent the past weekend with family in Connecticut camping.  But on the evening of June 13 he began to feel short of breath, without cough or chest pain, and the dyspnea was made worse with exertion.  Not made worse with lying down.  He also had a fever to 103, without mental status changes.  EMS was called and in the field he was noted to be breathing at a rate in the 40s; he was given a dose of IV lasix and he put out 600cc of urine.  He was then brought to the WMC ED where he continued to display labored breathing, breathing in the 40s, afebrile, tachycardic to 147bpm.  An ABG on BIPAP showed 7.35/53/100.  His blood pressure dropped from systolic 130s to 70/50, and so he was subsequently intubated, and a central and arterial lines placed.  He was given approximately 2L of NS with resultant CVP of 11.  He was also started on dopamine, which was eventually transitioned to norepinephrine.  He was given vancomycin, levaquin, and flagyl, as well as a dose of solumedrol.  He was then transferred to the Internal Medicine.

Review of Systems: per HPI; no changes in mental status; no cough, chest pain, palpitations; no N/V/C/D; no BRBPR or melena; no sick contacts.

Assessment and Plan

Mr. Pearson is a pleasant 87 year old gentleman with a history of COPD, never intubated, who presented with one day of dyspnea.  He had a fever to 103, and presented with hypotension and respiratory distress requiring intubation.  He has an elevated wbc and an increased creatinine to 1.6; his chest x-ray is consistent with a RUL and RML pneumonia, and he has a low bnp negative for cardiac stretching.  His presentation is consistent with sepsis secondary to pneumonia.

Sepsis: continue EGDT, with goal MAP>65 and goal CVP of 8-12
a. IVF with NS for goal CVP 8-12
b. pressors as needed (vasopressin +/- levophed) for goal MAP>65 (currently off pressors)
c. monitor urine output
d. measure central venous oxygen saturation
e. antibiotics for pneumonia: would treat with vancomycin and cefepime, check vancomycin trough tomorrow am
f.  f/u all culture data
g. continue advair 250/50
h. no need for steroids currently, and will not check cort-stim in setting of having received solumedrol in ED
i.  hold antihypertensives (losartan 100mg qd and toprol 100mg qd) in setting of hypotension

ARF: creatinine up to 1.6 from baseline of 1.1, likely pre-renal etiology in setting of sepsis; will give trial hydration

Ppx: ranitidine and heparin
