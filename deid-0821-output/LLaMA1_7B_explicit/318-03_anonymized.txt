The problem is I am getting this error:

\begin{code}
Unclosed token 'T:' detected at line 19, column 102.
\end{code}

I'm using the following code:

\begin{code}
public static void main(String[] args)
{
   String[] doc = new String[] { "doc1.txt", "doc2.txt" };
   for(int i = 0; i < doc.length; i++)
      System.out.println(parseDoc(doc[i]));
}

public static String parseDoc(String doc)
{
   String docLine = doc; //doc is a path to the text file, this is the only way to read the file.
   try
   {
      StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(docLine);
      String line = st.nextToken();
      line = st.nextToken();
      String[] docArray = line.split("T: ");
      return docArray[1];
   //System.out.println(parseDoc(doc));
   }
   catch(Exception ex)
   {
      ex.printStackTrace();
   }
   return null;
}
\end{code}

Comment: This is a simple tokenizer. You're using it wrong.

Comment: Can you please give me a simple example of how I would do this?

Comment: The tokenizer is fine, it can be used to read the file in. But the line you are trying to tokenize doesn't make sense (at least to me). You need to split the string into two: one part with the T: and a second one without it, then parse the second part as an `Integer.parseInt`.

Comment: I have no problem tokenizing the string, it works fine, but I cannot parse that string to an integer.

Answer: I'd recommend to use an HTML parser (like [JSoup](http://jsoup.org/) for example). It's a bit more work, but much more robust than parsing raw text by hand.

For example you could parse the HTML and split on \begin{code}
<tr>
\end{code} tags. Then each of the `td` tags will be the patient information. You'll have to split again on \begin{code}
\end{code} (the line break is \begin{code}
\end{code}).

\begin{code}
<tr>
  <td>...</td><td>
 ...
</td><td>
\end{code}

Answer: You will have to split on T:, and then you have to parse each of the lines and get the second half.

This will give u what's after the first half of the string, the patient number.  Then you will get the patient name and number.

Then you will get the first half of the string, the name and age and then you will get the first half of the name and the first half of the age and the name and the first names.
the patient numbers.
