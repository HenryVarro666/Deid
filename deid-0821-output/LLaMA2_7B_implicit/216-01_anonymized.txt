MARVINYANDELL,GRACE   904-68-07-1              VISIT DATE: 08/06/96

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This patient is a 68 year old 

woman who is being seen by Dr. Dodd who had what was a syncopal 

episode on the premises.  A code was called when bystanders and 

medics reported she was on the floor, diaphoretic and clammy.  The 

patient drank something and then proceeded to be taken to the 

Emergency Department. 

The patient had a cystoscopy planned for today.  She took her 

medication for her diabetes and presented here with weakness, 

nausea, diaphoresis and felt like she may have passed out.  Her 

other complaint was mild back pain from passing out.  No epigastric 

pain or tenderness and no chest pain.  The patient never had any 

chest pain prior to her event.  She is followed by the United Medical Center East and their input is pending at this point. 

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient has a past medical history 

significant for diabetes, hypertension, hypothyroidism and 

migraines. 

MEDICATIONS:  The patient's current medications include Plavix, 

Calan slow release and Glucophage. 

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to intravenous pyelogram dye, 

Percocet, penicillin, cephalosporin and lisinopril. 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  HEENT:  Examination is normal.  LUNGS: 

Clear bilaterally.  CARDIAC:  Regular rate and rhythm with no 

murmurs.  ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender.  EXTREMITIES:  Normal. 

GENERAL:  The patient looks well and has no complaints here. 

LABORATORY EVALUATION:  Finger stick in the Emergency Department 

was 160.  Electrocardiogram shows some PR depressions in multiple 

leads.  No significant ST elevations. 

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  Impression is this patient is a 68 

year old female with planned cystoscopy today who passed out on the 

premises.  A code was called overhead.  Bystanders reported that 

the patient was diaphoretic.  They gave her something to drink. 

Her blood sugar here was within normal limits.  The patient has no 

complaints of chest pain or shortness of breath.  She looks well 

but does have PR depressions on electrocardiogram but has no rubs 

or gallops on her electrocardiogram.  The patient was made NPO 

because of her cystoscopy procedure. 

FINAL DIAGNOSES: 

1.  Syncopal episode versus presyncope from the taking of her 

diabetes medicine this morning. 

2.  PR depression on electrocardiogram which appears to be new.  No 

old electrocardiogram to compare.  We need to address the PR 

depressions.  This is possibly pericarditis but it is unlikely.  I 

would think that this more likely ischemia than pericarditis. 

3.  Cardiac ischemia. 

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient will 

need admission and a formal rule out.  She may even need an 

echocardiogram inpatient.  A full work up is pending.  The 

patient's full disposition is pending and she was signed out to Dr. 

Aleta Nunley at 15:00.
