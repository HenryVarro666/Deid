HPI: 	The patient is a 55 year old male with a past medical history significant for chronic renal failure (secondary to diabetes & hypertension) and gastrointestinal mucormycosis who was recently admitted for a clotted AVF, s/p thrombectomy.

    NO GROWTH 1 DAY 


Impression:  55 year old male with chronic renal failure, hypertension, diabetes and gastrointestinal mucormycosis who is s/p recent tunnelled catheter placement, now presenting with fever post HD, GPC in blood.

ID- Likely catheter related infection, will continue vanco for now, await speciation of GPC. Will recx if spikes above 101.5. FU urine cx. Vanco/Gent. Ultimately needs line out.

ESRD-continue dialysis schedule, will continue nephrocaps, calcitrol, procrit

Hypertension

Will continue outpatient regime

DM- Sliding scale insulin

Heme Protein C and S levels decreased on repeat testing. I believe protein C can be influenced by ESRD, but not protein S. This needs to be followed up further.

Prophylaxis

DVT prophylaxis: 	Fragmin 

GI prophylaxis: 	nexium
